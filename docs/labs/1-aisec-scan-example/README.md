## Goals 
The goal of this lab is to reproduce the results of passive and active fingerprinting of Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence Frameworks and Applications using a common Threat Intelligence approach and to answer the following questions:

* How to detect AI/ML backed systems in the Internet and Enterprise network? 
* Are AI/ML apps secure at Internet scale? 
* What is AI/ML apps security level in a general sense at present? 

## This Lab Contains
1. This document with additional information and description
1. Additional `.sh` scripts with set of different scanning commands

## Prerequisites and Requirements
### TL;DR
:bulb: **Note #1:** The fastest and recommended way
  
1. Install [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/)  
1. Install [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)  
1. Clone and run the Grinder Framework. These commands will drop you directly into the running container with Grinder
```bash
git clone https://github.com/sdnewhop/grinder.git
cd grinder/
chmod +x docker_build.sh docker_run.sh
./docker_build.sh
./docker_run.sh
```
4. From the other terminal window, check that both services are ready and up  
```bash
CONTAINER ID        IMAGE                           COMMAND                  CREATED             STATUS              PORTS                    NAMES

```
![Running Services](/docs/labs/1-aisec-scan-example/assets/services_up.png?raw=true "Running services")

  
If everything is okay there - **congratulations!** :sparkles: Continue with steps 5-7.  
If something is wrong, see the :point_right: [Troubleshooting](#troubleshooting) notes below. If you want to try different possible options for the installation, see the :point_right: [Installation and Running Options](#installation-and-running-options) part below.
  
5. _(Additional)_ Copy scripts to the container from the other terminal window (or you can copy-paste commands from them, that will be fine too)
```bash
(on host system)        docker cp docs/labs/1-aisec-scan-example/commands grinder_framework:/app
(in running container)  chmod +x /app/commands/*
```
6. _(Additional)_ Set your Shodan or Censys keys as an environment variable (to skip the `-sk` key and use the Grinder Framework without this key)  
```bash
export SHODAN_API_KEY=YOUR_SHODAN_API_KEY_HERE
```
7. _(Additional)_ Run any script from `/app/commands/` in your running container to start the scan
```bash
./commands/basic.sh
```
  
### Troubleshooting
:bulb: **Note #2 (Troubleshooting):** If something goes wrong with `./docker_build.sh` or `./docker_run.sh`, run it with `sudo`:  
```bash
sudo ./docker_build.sh
sudo ./docker_run.sh
```
  
:bulb: **Note #3 (Troubleshooting):** Or add yourself to the `Docker` group, if you don't want to run it with `sudo`:  
```bash
sudo groupadd docker
sudo gpasswd -a $USER docker
```
Log out and log in to activate the group changes, and try to run the scripts again:  
```bash
./docker_build.sh
./docker_run.sh
```
### Installation and Running Options
To run the scan with the Grinder Framework you need to have the computer or virtual machine with installed Linux-flavoured systems like Kali Linux or Ubuntu. MacOS is also ok and fully supported.

The preferred way to run the Grinder Framework in case of the lab environment (or if you don't want to install all the dependencies and other things directly into your system) is to build it with Docker - for more information about this method you can follow the next section of the documentation: :point_right: [Building and Running in Docker](https://github.com/sdnewhop/grinder/tree/add_labs#building-and-running-in-docker)

To install the Grinder framework with all the dependencies directly, you can follow the next section of the documentation: :point_right: [Grinder Installing](https://github.com/sdnewhop/grinder/tree/add_labs#grinder-installing)

## Running and Scanning
### Basic Scan
:bulb: **Note #4 (Speed):** This is the most basic scan, so depends on different reasons it might be **slow** (30-45 minutes for all 50+ products from AI-Finger). If you want to try the basic idea faster with fewer results, you can go to the next part below (see :point_right: [Faster Scan with Fewer Results](#faster-scan-with-fewer-results))

To get the basic scanning results with different ML/AI solutions from the Grinder Framework you can run the following command inside the running Docker container shell (which you will get after `./docker_run.sh` running):
```bash
./grinder.py -r -u -q queries/aisec_aifinger_all.json -sk YOUR_SHODAN_API_KEY_HERE -cu -cp -ni
```
This command will do the following:
1. `-r` - initiate scan run
1. `-u` - update map markers to put all the results on the interactive map
1. `-q queries/aisec_aifinger_all.json` - select the file with the queries. In this case, we use `aisec_aifinger_all.json` query file.
1. `-sk YOUR_SHODAN_API_KEY_HERE` - your paid plan API key for the Shodan
1. `-cu` - count unique entities, like unique vulnerabilities, countries, continents etc.
1. `-cp` - create graphical plots to visualize the unique data
1. `-ni` - not increment any previous results (because for now we don't have any earlier results)
  
:bulb: **Note #5 (Censys Scan):** If you also have Censys API account with a paid plan, you can add it with the following keys:
```
  -ci CENSYS_ID, --censys-id CENSYS_ID
                        Censys API ID key
  -cs CENSYS_SECRET, --censys-secret CENSYS_SECRET
                        Censys API SECRET key
```
:bulb: **Note #6 (Limit Results):** If you want to speed up scanning (in case if you don't need to get overall full results), you can set the results limit for every query - for example, 10-100 hosts per query. To do this, you can use the following keys:
```
  -cm CENSYS_MAX, --censys-max CENSYS_MAX
                        Censys default maximum results quantity (for example, --censys-max 50)
  -sm SHODAN_MAX, --shodan-max SHODAN_MAX
                        Shodan default maximum results quantity (for example, --shodan-max 50)
```
  
### Faster Scan with Fewer Results
To get the faster scanning process with different ML/AI solutions from the Grinder Framework you can run the following command inside the running Docker container shell (which you will get after `./docker_run.sh` running):
```bash
./grinder.py -r -u -q queries/aisec_aifinger_all.json -sk YOUR_SHODAN_API_KEY_HERE -cu -cp -ni -sm 50 -cm 50 -vc certain -qc certain
```
This command will do the following:
1. `-r` - initiate scan run
1. `-u` - update map markers to put all the results on the interactive map
1. `-q queries/aisec_aifinger_all.json` - select the file with the queries. In this case, we use `aisec_aifinger_all.json` query file.
1. `-sk YOUR_SHODAN_API_KEY_HERE` - your paid plan API key for the Shodan
1. `-cu` - count unique entities, like unique vulnerabilities, countries, continents etc.
1. `-cp` - create graphical plots to visualize the unique data
1. `-ni` - not increment any previous results (because for now we don't have any earlier results)
1. `-sm 50` - limit Shodan results with 50 hosts per query
1. `-cm 50` - limit Censys results with 50 hosts per query (if Censys keys are provided)
1. `-vc certain` - include only trusted presice vendors
1. `-qc certain` - include only trusted presice queries

### Include Additional Checks
You can also run an active phase scanning with Nmap Network Scanner or/and Vulners API Script. To do it, add the following keys:
```
  -nm, --nmap-scan      Initiate Nmap scanning
  -nw NMAP_WORKERS, --nmap-workers NMAP_WORKERS
                        Number of Nmap workers to scan
  -vs, --vulners-scan   Initiate Vulners API scanning
  -vw VULNERS_WORKERS, --vulners-workers VULNERS_WORKERS
                        Number of Vulners workers to scan
```
So the Grinder Framework scanning command can be the following:
```bash
./grinder.py -r -u -q queries/aisec_aifinger_all.json -sk YOUR_SHODAN_API_KEY_HERE -cu -cp -ni -sm 50 -cm 50 -vc certain -qc certain -nm -nw 50 -vs -vw 50
```

## Results
### Framework Output
After running any of the commands from above, you will see the following output (the quantity and queries are just an example, your results and console output may be slightly different):
```

```
Wait until the scanning process will finish (it will take some time, which depends on your network connection, API plan, Shodan API endpoint load, etc.).

### Results Structure
When the scanning process is finished, you can see the results in `grinder/results/` directory. The structure of the results is:  
```bash
results
├── csv
├── json
└── png
    ├── all_results
    └── limited_results

5 directories
```
:bulb: **Note #7 (Recommended Representation):** `JSON` format is a preferable representation for the results. The main file that includes all the results is `results/json/all_results.json`

The structure can be described as:
1. `csv` - all results in `CSV` format representation
1. `json` - all results in `JSON` format representation
1. `png` - different plots and graphics

### Results Format
The resulting file (`all_results.json`) format can be described with the following example:
```json
[
    {
        "product": "Megarac SP",
        "vendor": "American Megatrends",
        "query": "\"3.14.17-ami\"",
        "port": 123,
        "proto": "ntp",
        "ip": "**.**.**.**",
        "lat": 51.4416,
        "lng": 7.5633,
        "country": "Germany",
        "organization": "O2 Deutschland",
        "vulnerabilities": {
            "shodan_vulnerabilities": {},
            "vulners_vulnerabilities": {}
        },
        "nmap_scan": {},
        "scripts": {
            "py_script": null,
            "nse_script": null
        }
    }
]
```
The plots example from the `results/png/limited_results/`. This plots were based on the data from 100 random hosts.

![Results by Organizations](/docs/labs/1-aisec-scan-example/assets/results_organizations.png?raw=true "Results by Organizations")

## Interactive Map
The map service starts automatically with the container. The container will expose port 5000 to the host machine, so you can get access to the map via [http://localhost:5000/](http://localhost:5000/) when scanning is finished. 

The map service allows you to find and sort results by a vendor, products, CVEs, and many other things. To do it, try to use the search field in the right upper corner of the map. Also, the map service provides basic information about the hosts.

For example:  
1. To show only American Megatrends Megarac SP product on the map, search for it with "Megarac SP" phrase:  
:point_right: [http://localhost:5000/search?query=Megarac+SP](http://localhost:5000/search?query=Megarac+SP)
1. To find a host by IP, you can search for it directly:  
:point_right: [http://localhost:5000/search?query=180.150.54.99](http://localhost:5000/search?query=180.150.54.99)
1. To search for some particular protocol, for example, `https-simple-new`:  
:point_right: [http://localhost:5000/search?query=https-simple-new](http://localhost:5000/search?query=https-simple-new)

All available routes:
```
